Tom ate nothing.
I told you this would happen.
You shouldn't have killed her.
He has the advantage of a good education.
You're really a good cook.
Why didn't you call us?
Tom isn't foolish.
His clothes are out of fashion.
I want to get some stuff done.
Could you be here by 2:30?
We need to meet with him.
I have a boss who's much younger than me.
I don't quite feel at ease yet.
Tom didn't know how to treat his employees right.
Tom went to the office.
They're all older than you.
All boys are the same.
Lucy is from America.
They urged him to punish the rebels.
Tom doesn't think Mary is fit for the job.
Do you wanna talk?
I didn't kill her.
Tom might be a lot safer than we are at this moment.
Can we go for a walk?
I stayed as long as I could.
He said he had lost his vigor at forty.
Could you please explain what's going on here?
Are you going to Tom's birthday party?

It's not like we're going to get married or anything.
I want to show you how to do that.
What kind of dog is it?
Could you prepare the salad?
Men can't live without football.
At one time I was saying I want to become a novelist.
Tom is the name of Tom.
Is this clock working?
I'll meet him some other time.
Tom may have seen you come in.
I'm not afraid to die.
Who does that with you?
He lives like a monk.
How did you think it would go?
Tom said I could wait here until he got back.
How are we supposed to prevent that from happening?
We can't tell you anything.
I don't believe he is a lawyer.
Why don't you try making Tom an offer?
Tom can't afford to have an automobile.
Tom needs to get got.
I like rock and roll.
We had a plan.
This door can't be locked.
I'm ready to work hard.
Tom soon fell asleep.
What makes you think Tom isn't a Canadian?
My TV is broken.
Tell Tom to do that later.
I'll send you a message.
I am a citizen of Chiba, but work in Tokyo.
Tom is a gang member. You should stay away from him.
It was going to be a surprise.
Somebody told him.
Tom should've been eating more vegetables and not as much meat.
I should have paid more attention to her feelings.
They would support his financial plan.
I've got something I need to do.
Tom was standing outside.
Why are we here?
Tell Tom I don't need his help whatsoever.
Layla killed in self-defense.
You've hit the nail on the head!
Tom should go see a doctor.
Tom told me that he didn't remember Mary's last name.
Layla can't have children.
Tom handled it perfectly.
If you eat a spoonful of sugar or a small piece of whole wheat bread, it seems that the bread would be less detrimental.
I knew that I shouldn't be doing that.
Have you spoken to your parents about this?
He spent no more money than was necessary.
That's quite an understatement.
Will you please be seated?
They're hungry.
Mary is a leftist.
Maybe you can help me out here.
I didn't like to write official letters.
Let him pay for it.
They chatted for a moment.
Tom didn't ask.
I was asked if Tom could speak French.
Where is my saxophone?
I think I may have a solution.
I only found out about it purely by accident.
I don't want you hanging out with Tom.
The child tumbled down the stairs.
Why are you looking at me? Is it something on my face?
Karl called Amelia at once.
I found out that he was a pimp.
Sami was support and strength and security to Layla.
They don't want you to know.
I drank tea.

Tom was a wonderful man.
Tom and I often do the same thing.
She wasn't there last month.
My father will travel abroad next year.
I'm just trying to have a little fun.
I can't stand the noise.
Formidable looking spiders do not attack people.
What'll we do when we get there?
Tom wants to borrow some money.
We'll load the van.
I'm going to do that next fall.
You're much cuter than your sister.
We won't be able to arrive home in time.
It's just a job, you know?
The books are small.
Let's get back to the boat.
Can you please come fix this?
Do I need to go there?
Tom is doing that again, isn't he?
There's something I need to do.
I've given up smoking.
I wasn't ready for it.
Watch your head.
You had better not wear the red dress. "Why not?"
I don't want to run into her.
I study about two hours every day.
You seem a bit edgy today. Is something bothering you?
The two boys traveled throughout the land.
I should have listened to you.
The baby is crying for milk.
Sami was fixing an escalator.
Hello, I'm Mike.
Is there something going on that I don't know about?
Tom isn't supposed to do that today.
My canteen is already half empty.
The school is located at the foot of a hill.
I hope you had a good night's sleep.
Soak them overnight.
I don't know what to say to make you feel better.
If only I'd listened to what Tom said, I wouldn't be in this kind of trouble.
You should do your best in everything.
I lost the door key, so I can't enter the house.
This is the first time I've ever commented a sentence.
I've clean forgotten.
We're saving up to build a new house.
You just don't give up, do you?
The prisoner was pardoned by the governor.
The girl was carrying several books. Not textbooks, but thick hardback books.
Tom could do that if he tried.
Yesterday I had to work overtime.
I am not a lawyer.
What time do you watch the news?
He's closing everything.
He later married her.
Sami wanted to be a dancer.
There is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.
Tom might not be at Mary's party tonight.
Someone has to help me.
Tom is quite affectionate.
Didn't I just tell you not to do that?
Oh, it's cool. I like it.
That's part of the fun.
She should get a new computer.
I just had my hair done.
I will certainly never have a son.
Tom seemed to recognize Mary.
Tom was supposed to come.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Check with Tom.
Karl started a coup.
I'll see you at dinner.
Tom was standing just in front of a large building that was up for sale.
You gain nothing by speaking ill of others.
I suspect that you won't like it.
Don't forget your ticket!
Could I ask you a question?
I said we'd take care of it.
Does Tom have an older brother?
It doesn't start until eight thirty.
My notebook is pink.
Tom drove Mary to the station.
The way we tried to solve the problem didn't work.
I didn't know you could sing so well.
I'll replace it.
My essay isn't very good.
I don't recall asking for your opinion.
I bet I know what's wrong.
My sister saw it with her own eyes.
I prefer to do it on my own.
Do you want to buy a duck?
I wonder whether or not Tom was embarrassed.
Things were simple back then.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Weather reports rarely come true.
Tom might've been the one who told Mary that.
Let's try it.
Even when he was a child, Fadil tormented his siblings.
If there's anything else you need, just let me know.

I didn't drink too much.
I couldn't stop myself from yawning.
The island was struck by the typhoon.
You can't give up on me.
Tom's school day is divided into six periods.
I wonder how Tom learned French.
The Taliban doesn't have the technical knowledge and skills to govern and develop the country without support and investment from neighboring countries like China.
What do you mean you don't know?!
Tom doesn't do that well.
I like tea.
You scratch my back. I'll scratch yours.
We discuss many things.
A storm arose.

At this rate, I'll never be finished.
She witnessed him being killed.
What country is it close to?
Tom is the victim of a terrible crime.
'Hayastan' is Armenia's name in Armenian.
You should be the one to talk to Tom about what happened.
I wrote a thousand sentences!
I'm sorry, but I have forgotten your name.
We've got to get you to the hospital.
Who didn't write his name?
I bet Tom would be glad if Mary didn't come tonight.
Neither Tom nor Mary was at the meeting.
Excuse me for one moment.
Tom borrowed my car.
Tom poured Mary a cup of coffee and topped off his own.
If you want to, you can use my car.
You still don't look very happy.
It's hot down here.
I know that Tom is rich.
It's my turn to roll the dice.
There's a label on the jar.
I saw Tom whisper something in Mary's ear.
I now realize why Tom was angry with me.
That sounds exhausting.
Where can I buy a shirt like that?
I often play soccer after school.
I don't like what you're doing.
Make me a sandwich.
No. I want to pay in cash.
Tom said that he knew that he might not be permitted to do that at school.
Tom isn't due for another three hours.
I'm from here.
Do you think I should take it?
Do you want some raisins?
We are Noldor. I’m Hísiel. Are you one of the Sindar?
You should resign.

Tom stopped moving.
That's odd.
I'm pretty sure I can do it one way or another.
You need to get some exercise.
The prison was my university.
Tom isn't my brother. He's my cousin.
Tom ought to have done that by now.

At the time, I thought it was a mistake.

Tom wanted to see it.
Tom was beginning to feel awkward.
How does she know that?

Tom couldn't get that.
Do you like squash soup?
She's not ugly.
Why aren't you helping me at all?
We were caught in a shower on the way to school.
The new film was a great success.
Why did you tell him?
Sami gave Layla her money back.
What can Tom do about that?
China is a major economic power, with one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
Tom came into the room and started yelling.
There was nothing Tom could do.
Mary told me that she loved me.
We couldn't do that without a lot of help.
I think three of those would be enough.
How self-important you are!
As soon as I got home, it began to rain.
Tatoeba was sick and almost died.
Do you fancy anyone?
When was the last time Tom was late?
How often do you give blood?
They betrayed you.
That was fairly obvious.
The man that you saw there yesterday was Mr. Brown.
I couldn't hear anything you said.
Tom and I went to the park together.
I am going to Paris tomorrow.
I've been very worried about you.

You're all responsible for what happened to me.
Do you play tennis very often?
Are you two ready?
He was anxious for his brother to meet you.
I don't know any of you.
That's exactly what they want us to do.
I know what's wrong with them.
Tom thanked Marie for her gift.
There is still something I don't understand.
We're all waiting because there's no news about the test results yet.
No matter how hard he may work, he will not be able to pass the exams.
They have to integrate into society.
The treaty is now a dead letter.
There are too many bridges in this city.
It might not be as hard to do that as you think it'll be.
Nothing will stop his going.
Tom says he's disappointed.
They bumped against each other.
Let me repair it.
Is that true?
I didn’t take you for such a selfless person.
I failed to move it for it was very heavy.
She brought me some tea and sat down on my bed.
May I sit on your knee?
The big dog is frightening them.
I'll do the best I can.
This is better than nothing.
Tom was clearly skeptical.
Was your mother busy last Monday?
Has your father ever cut your hair?
You've got me curious.
I'm old enough to be her father.
This isn't my first time riding a bicycle.
Why aren't you there?
I should congratulate you.
I want them to feel what I felt.
I want to apologize to everyone here.
This is why I was afraid to tell you.
If you had been a little more patient, you would have succeeded.
Am I the only one worried that Tom will be late?
I always got up early in my childhood.
Fadil knew that if he needed something, he had just to make one phone call.

What do you really think of Tom?
I've left my watch at home.
Tom is going in the wrong direction.

Extension 45, please.
How did you know where to find us?
No one told me that she had failed.
I can't express myself in French as well as I'd like to.
Jamal and Sarah arrived in Cairo.
Germany did not want war with the United States.
Tom clearly doesn't want to be doing this.
That's a pretty picture.
We ought to help each other.
I can't reach that can of tomatoes.
Tom's brother is a nurse.
Turn off the TV before going to bed, OK?
Tom won't likely be jealous.
He never talked about his beliefs.
He borrowed some money from his father as a last resort.
I thought I told you I didn't want you to talk to Tom about that.
Kalman was so excited to be in that tent.
Tom is pulling Mary's hair.
We just want Tom to come home.

It was very weird.
Send her my regards.
Tom needs to talk to you.

The consequence of a wrong translation can sometimes be catastrophic.
Doing that would be a bad idea.

You were right about them.
Tom has just moved.

What was your worst nightmare ever?
Come on, Tom. Talk to me.

What is mathematics good for?
Tom feels he offended Mary, and that's why she's not here.
I almost died that night.
They speak English and French in Canada.
Tom says he used to teach French.
I was born in San Francisco.
That transcription is wrong.
You told Mary, didn't you?
I know that you don't want to be killed.
Their clothes were used.
That's just what I wanted.
Tom didn't agree with our decision.
Do I need to go to the dentist's?
Tom thought that Mary liked him.
There's a car coming.
Tom knew he wouldn't be allowed to stay.
I work hard in the garden in the morning.
Do you have a son?
Spring returned.
Is it really OK to spend that much money on a gift for your boss?
I have a bad feeling.
Make yourself useful.

Seen at a distance, the rock looks like a squatting human figure.

They would kill me if they found out.
Tom didn't know what had happened to Mary.
Tom has nice skin.
I think you're being a bit overdramatic.
Kalman and Olivia planned to spend the night together.
Why not get a job?
We should all have dinner.
I've not seen him in a long time.
I know you aren't ready to deal with this.
Tom has a lot of work to do before he can go home.
I'm getting rid of her.
Tom knew that he was right.
I scored 100 on the maths exam.
Tom said he'd never ever do that again.
Well, I watch television.
Everyone around here likes me.
This pillow is too soft for me.
I got up at six in the morning.
You may rely on him.
I wonder if Tom will be here today.
Tom and I are still very busy.
I've never wanted anything so much in my life.
When are you going to talk to me?
Tom pulled Mary out of the pool.
Hand me a towel.
In the evening, I read my son a book.
I'm not outgoing.
Mary is an ingenuous student.
Sami decided to take Layla home.
Tom isn't young.
We are grateful for the music he left behind.
Layla drank her body fluids.
Tom showed me a picture of Mary.
Tom sat very still on the couch.
His finger bleeds.
If you're not happy, quit.
Tom couldn't help but look disappointed.
Tom walked as fast as he could to catch up with Mary.
He'll write a letter.
I think that Tom lives somewhere around here.
I don't want him to hear.
This river flows too fast to swim in.
Tom wasn't quite ready.
What're you planning to do after you retire?
I don't blame you for this.
I used to be like them.
Tom is here and he'd like to talk to you.
Don't leave Boston yet.
Barely a third of the population in this country have access to the Internet.
Don't you think you'll be able to help me?
Tom isn't sure Mary knew she had to do that.
I love French movies.
Tom grew up here.
Don't touch her!
How do you know Tom isn't happy?
Aren't you glad we cleared that up?
I'll have to take her with me.
Tom resigned.
We knew Tom would win.
Yesterday was Tom's birthday.
Most of Alexander Pichushkin's killings took place in Moscow's Bitsa Park between 1992 and 2006.
I thought that Tom would be able to help you.
Tom wanted Mary to help him clean the living room.
Tom can still play the piano even though he doesn't own one now.
Would you like to know who she is?
You're not getting your money today.
My sister is younger than you.
We fit together well.
My secretary is incompetent.
I'll give him a hand.
I don't have the authority.
Tom didn't do that and Mary didn't either.
The little boy held his mother's hand firmly when crossing the street.
Do you have anything in particular you want to know?
No problem.
Which parking space is Tom's?
This conversation is over. Bye.
I'm kind to everyone and grateful.
The accident happened right before my eyes.
You're really confusing me.
Your son doesn't respect privacy.
I'm calling him again.
It's a good day for a picnic.
What are you up to today?
Tom is the only one who's likely to be able to do that.
Tom told everybody he was ready.
What was it that you wanted me to tell Tom?
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom wasn't hungry either.
I thought you might be curious.
No one wants to answer that question.
Tom has spoken to me.
That's why spectators love you.
I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened at school today.
Is Tom going to do it or not?
I got in the boat.
Tom works very hard.
He looks just like his mother.
I'm sick of Tom jamming his opinions down my throat.
Has something else happened?
I've decided to get into politics.
I wish I could've persuaded Tom to join us.
Something is very wrong.
A chance like this only comes along once in a lifetime.
Mary's boyfriend is older than her father.
Tom is a very manipulative person.
I feel very old.
I tried to persuade Tom to do that, but I couldn't.
I give you my word.
Tom has a brother who's a carpenter.
I'm crazy.
They're having fun.
Tom was a self-made millionaire.
That was brilliant.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
We were talking about him.

I'm not having much luck.
She is far from honest.
I heard that he was very experienced in overseas investments.
I'm really proud of you.
Does Tom know I want him to do that?
I need to get my oboe repaired.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
Layla, an Aborigine, made use of her renowned tracking skills.
I guess you miss Tom.
We'll have some exceptions.
You really should've eaten more for breakfast.
Tom took off his sweater and put it in his locker.
Even if it takes you three years, you must accomplish your goal.
I'm not in a position to give you advice.
Alberto went skiing again.
The more I get, the more I want.
He was at a party.
Both Tom and Mary saw you.
Tracy lost her glasses.
How could you forget it?
Tom asked for Mary's address and wrote it down on a piece of scrap paper.
I've apologized, so get off my back.
Tom didn't do well on today's test.
To tell the truth, I had forgotten all about our appointment.
Tom didn't thank us for what we did. What a rude!
Tom called Mary every bad name he could think of.
You've really done a fine job.
I didn't pull the trigger.
Jackson said this was wrong.
Doors aren't as bad as you think.
I had hardly opened my mouth, when she interrupted me.
It was you that suggested seeing that movie.
Sami's girlfriend was Layla.
Tom always wants to do everything by himself.
It's not music.
When I first met him, I thought he was putting on airs.
There's a pig in the sty.
Tom stayed here.
We aren't alone.
I wish someone would help me with English composition.
I'm worried about him.
She stood by him whenever he was in trouble.
We differed as to the solution to the problem.
I was a little early.
The event is on Friday.
Mustafa, look at the horse.
I'll get you something.
I really like that car.
You won't have any trouble finding a place to live.
I thought that we had the better team.
I saw them jump into the pool.
Tom deserves the firing squad.
If I had a choice, I probably wouldn't be doing this.
Tom'll die.
My feet are bigger than yours.
Summer doesn't last very long.
A book came for you in the mail today.
The locals call this river the "man-eater" and fear it.
Tom wouldn't do that, so I asked Mary to.
You can do so much better than that.
Sami will die in prison.
Claude Monet was a famous impressionist painter.
I got those pictures you wanted.
Our uncle bought us movie tickets.
Tom decided to do that again.
Sami kept to that promise.
The last thing Tom needs is another stalker.
Tom was too frightened to do that.

Seen from a distance, this mountain looks like Mt. Fuji.

I didn't agree to help you.
All the old magazines have been sold.
We can go together if you wish.
Tom forgot to bring a flashlight.
Dude, that really happened!
He doesn't watch any television.
I think I'm falling in love.
Don't act so innocent with me. I know what you're up to.
I hate that cat.
Ask Tom to call me. He has my number.
The clouds are getting darker.
I would have encouraged my students.
He planned to stay in the Navy.
I have other business.
Life seems so unfair.
She gave me the evil eye.
The sun is big.
Tom and I helped each other.
I thought you'd reach the same conclusion as I did.
She is the most beautiful girl in our class.
They got thoroughly wet in the rain.
A person who is only a pawn in the game often talks big in company.
I'll go to college.
What was Tom saying?
Is fast food really healthy?
What makes you think we should buy something for Tom?
How many books have you read so far this summer?
I watch movies almost every day.
I've never seen Tom acting like this before.
Sometimes it takes more than one person to do this.
Tom doesn't have to worry about it.
Mary wants you to be polite.
The post office is a good five kilometers away from here.
I've met the perfect woman.
A little soap and water never killed anybody.
Hi, everyone.
We spent our holiday in Boston.
The man was held in police custody.
Tom is waiting for me now.
Tom heard us sing.
I think Tom isn't going to win.
Hello. "Wa alaikum assalam."
I wonder if we'll ever find out what happened.
Tom thought that Mary would do the right thing.
He felt pity for us.

I haven't yet been paid.
Tom is working late.
I saw her earlier this morning.
Do you know how much it costs?
He was a rugby player.
Why are you saying you want to walk in the park?
I did better than everyone expected.
I've always thought you weren't very smart.
The point is whether she will read the letter or not.

I have a severe headache.
This has become a yearly tradition.
We must pay attention to the traffic light.
Did they say what happened?
That uncle of his often visited America.
What're you going to tell him?
I'm just a farmer.
Why did you put it there?
He arrived too early.
He's drinking red wine.
Just stay out of it.
I don't want you to quit your job.
We won't know.
I've been hungry all day.
Tom's prognosis is very good.
Is anybody waiting in the lobby?
I know that Tom is your friend.
Tom no longer lives in Boston.
You are not to speak to him while he is studying.
We hope the public will join us.
Just wait!

Even Tom was somewhat impressed.
Have you finished filling?
Tom will try to find out why Mary doesn't want to do that.
I framed the picture.
You will succeed in this.
Life is too short.
Tom promised me he wouldn't be late.

Now give me back my key.
I thought we weren't going to go there.
I play the guitar after school.
This movie is for adults only.
We were all very thirsty.
Tom couldn't rule out the possibility that someone had lit his house on fire.

I know Tom probably won't cry.
May I have some more coffee?

Why he killed himself is still a mystery.
I speak three languages.
Come down here.
Tom wriggled his toes.
Do you think there's any chance of that happening?
The argument is severely flawed.
I've enjoyed my stay here.
Do you think Tom is the one who broke the window?
High five!

He's working at his English.

Take your pick.
Take your passport with you, just in case.
You have to be realistic now.

We were so worried.
I'm miserable here.

In my opinion, this is quite unsuitable.

It is not especially hot today.

Get off my back!
Does anyone know what caused the problem?
Tom is hardly fit to run a company.
I can't guarantee we'll be able to get the job done by next Monday.
Two and a half hours ago.
It was a great night.
I can sleep on the couch.
It's nice to be back together.
I'm not as poor as I used to be.
I used to get yelled at for hogging the phone.
That idea isn't bad.
Where should I pick the tickets up?
Tom listened to Mary recite the poem that she had memorized.
What do I have to do this time?
Unfortunately, they're the majority.
He was living in the poorest neighborhood in town.
How do we reason with Tom?
That's a good school.
Which is your book?
This isn't my umbrella; it's somebody else's.
I would like to pay with cash.
They say they've already paid.
Your wife's on the phone.

He instantly regretted taking apart the laptop after realizing how many complex components there were inside.
Tell me why you didn't do it.
Tom didn't say anything at all.

We've come a long way since then.
Don't let it go to your head.
Have fun at the ball!
I seldom read books written in French.
We need to get you some help.
Tom had no sooner arrived than he was asked to leave.
I wasn't willing to do what Tom asked.
Don't you think your French is good enough to explain the problem?
Please give me a book.
You all display similar behavior.
Were you close to your dad?
That'll really make me sick.
She's not my girlfriend. She's my sister.
There was silence.
I'm still not sure I understand.
Tom jotted down something in his notebook.
She's the laziest person I know.
Give him a hand.
You look beautiful this evening.
You seem really familiar.

I know what's going on here.
If I don't get the job, I'll tell Tom.
I'm not worried about Tom. I'm worried about you, Mary.

He was young.
The way you're doing that's wrong.
What's done can't be undone.
I figured Tom was asleep.
He came home dead tired.
He hasn't come already, has he?
You certainly couldn't do worse.

You need to be proactive.
Tom said he thought Mary was scared.
Are you supposed to be here?
Hopefully he won't notice anything!

He's a professor of biology at Harvard.
Maria is rather sweet.

Ten million yen will be enough for the project.
I'll give you a call later today.
I spent five days in that filthy well. During that time, my only solution was praying.
I'm happy for the first time in my life.
Tom said that he wasn't nervous.
Tom told me that he wanted to buy his mother a pair of slippers.
You did what you could to help.
I shouldn't have lied to Tom.
They're coming.
He's very young. He's much younger than Tom.
What was the fight over?
Tom longed to see Mary again.
Linda filed for a legal separation.
Tom is a real character.
Do you want me to believe this?
I'm not going to be very happy.
Tom wasn't with Mary all afternoon.
Tom said this was to be expected.
Do you know how fast you were going?
I had never been so scared before.
We'll look after her.
Do you want to go for a walk?
I shouldn't have trusted them.
Why would we want to go to Boston?
Work as the ant.
Tom was at a party three nights ago.
When will you be in London?
He ratted us out.
My sister sometimes makes our dinner.
I wouldn't want you to think I was mean.
There were many cars on the street.
She did that for her sister.
I'm not sure that Tom would let anybody help him.
Do you plan to go overseas?
Tom was expelled from school.
Tom might not understand French.
Tom ran quickly down the stairs.
One police officer suffered minor injuries.
Tom must be angry with Mary.
Do you want a banana?
It's been raining for about a week.
I didn't want him to leave.
Mary thought her house was haunted.
In comparison to him, I am still older.
He has fully recovered and can already work again.
He studied English and afterwards math.
I wonder who killed her.
Tom thought Mary wasn't being very cooperative.
Tom didn't want to say hello.
I have a pickup truck.
Tom is probably still in his office.
Would you mind telling me all about it now?
I have to shave your chest for the electrocardiogram.
You tricked me!
Actually, I didn't want to ask you anything.
Did you go to Boston?
He goes jogging in every kind of weather.
I knew Tom wasn't busy.
I got there first.
Tom knows how to do this.
He could deduct the furnishing of his work room from his taxes.
I felt very uneasy.
I'll definitely try doing that today.
Tom said that he thought Mary wouldn't do that tomorrow.
Tom squeezed this orange juice himself.
The air conditioner seems to be working now.
There are few, if any, mistakes in his English.
But most of all he wondered what her name was.
He is not married.
Is everything you own in that chest?
Where did they take you?
I've got to learn to slow down.
We looked around for them.
Are you always like this?
Tom married a teacher.
Tom is sure that it was an accident.
I remember the word.
Tom would've tried to stop you.
Tom says he'll sing that song he wrote about you tonight.
They didn't run.
She remarried when she was in her mid-forties.
He promised me he'd be more careful in future.
Why are beautiful things so fragile?
My sword is my life.
To tell you the truth, I don't like him.
Tom only had thirty dollars.
Everyone stared at Tom.
Tom has already been fooled twice.
It's hard to believe, isn't it?
I have orchids of different shapes and colors.
You’re just a student.
I am a licensed veterinarian.
Tom started making mistakes.
He leaves for Tokyo at ten.
The English word "amoeba" and the Japanese word "tatoeba" don't rhyme.
Would you like to go with me? "You bet!"
I cannot run as fast as Jim.
He has a cold.
You should feel bad for Tom.
I wrote a memo.
Dice have differences in design in different cultures.
Are you going to go shopping next weekend?
What makes you think I'm going to help you?
Tom is a trumpet player.
I couldn't stop giggling.
Why do you need a doctor?
Could you wake me up at the same time tomorrow?
The police have arrested someone.
I consider him my enemy.
A good poker player can tell when someone's bluffing.
The doctor gave him the medicine.
Mary told me that she thought Tom would be angry.
I've answered that question already.
Tom lives in a treehouse.
He's standing outside the door.
She has a very good figure.
Which one is Tom?
She adds a lot of examples.
Sami asked Layla to stop.
The possibility of a lack of connection between the events can be dismissed immediately.
They're not criminals.
The student's cheating was easily caught out.
We'll look into that.
A kid was outdoors and played with a ball.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
Tom doesn't want me there.
Paint this room with a brush.
What time is the break?
It isn't easy to translate all your comments into Standard German.
It's a mysterious death.
We often associate black with death.
I want to know when Tom came to Boston.
None of us were satisfied with the system.
These are select peaches.
I speak Turkish.
It tastes great, too.
How do I get in touch with you?
I wonder if Tom is still chubby.
Tom knew that Mary wasn't in Boston.
I bet the prices won't be much higher than they were last time.
Tom rubbed his forehead.
I didn't enjoy it very much.
The story began at the insurance office.
Tom has been warned many times.
The bomb has been planted.
I can't lie to Tom anymore.
There are only two paths out from this house.
Today's pigs are tomorrow's hams.
The doctor came in carrying a black bag.
You should leave early.
Have you gone nuts?
Many people live together but don't get married.
Have you heard of me?
Tom held open the car door for Mary.
I think I might buy that house on Park Street that's for sale.
Pristina is the capital of Kosovo.
How long has Tom been up there?
This is a serious situation.
I think we should scrap this plan.
He deliberately broke the glass.
I have a present for you.
He came by car instead of by train.
Tom is much better at French than I am.
Tom gave me a French dictionary.
I've thought about you a lot.
Tom doesn't feel motivated to do that.
Tom is decisive, isn't he?
Tom was very upset.
It's possible Tom won't attend the meeting today.
Tom probably doesn't care.
What's Tom's favorite movie?
Tom isn't fussy.
Your name doesn't seem to be on the list.
Tom thinks Mary can swim.
Do you know how to use a word processor?
She said that she was ill.
Is this the train for New York?
The stars are shining.
We can still get better.
Tom is friends with Mary, isn't he?
She walked twenty miles daily.
They ate supper.
Sami created many problems.
Tom deserves to be compensated.
She performed her daily duties without any passion.
I don't want any hassles.
He's shorter than his father.
I have drunk all my milk.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that by herself.
Aren't you lucky?
Tom's amazed.
Who sent her?
They found Tom.
Just do that.
She's smart and ambitious.
We don't like rain.
Tom seems to be trying not to cry.
Tom sometimes annoys me.
You can never know what will happen.
What am I missing here?
At least Tom is honest.
Your life is in danger.
Tom never forgets anything.
She shot a gun.
Let me buy you a beer.
You know what it is, don't you?
Tom has whooping cough.
Mary got on her knees.
I don't like the neighborhood where Tom lives.
You have lovely eyes.
I'll be absent tomorrow.
Tom told Mary he needed her help.
I was grateful.
I'm not the father!
What type of cage do you recommend for a hedgehog?
I wonder why Tom and John don't have girlfriends.
Tom tried to conceal the truth.
Tom knows he has to do that soon.
I reminded him to write to his mother soon.
Tom pulled the curtains open.
Introduce yourself in French.
Tom had no idea what time Mary would get home.
I have a twin sister.
How could you even think such a thing?
You're being ridiculous.
Can I eat this bread?
If small mistakes are not corrected at once, they may lead to serious problems.
It happened really quickly.
Footprints were left on the floor.
Is this what you're looking for?
Tom hates himself.
We went to Boston to visit him.
Why would I want to help you?
Tom isn't the only one here who knows how to speak French.
Most Shakuhachi are made from bamboo, but recently some wooden ones have appeared.
This annoying bug has finally been fixed.
Sometimes it's just the opposite.
Tom's way of speaking gets on my nerves.
What did they say last?
You said you were ready.
I'm not worth it.
I hope Tom remembers how to do this.
They're sick.
I have a theory about them.
Mom and Dad are very nervous.
She has a headache.
Tom still uses a typewriter.

Which dictionary do you often use?
What kinds of job are you looking for?
I did that for Tom for free.
We have missed our train.
I hard-boiled an egg.
Tom has promised never to do that.
Get me the evidence.
They arrive at the train station in seven hours.
Nobody offered me help.
Where is the security guard?
I really want Tom to stop doing that.
I will make every effort to pass the entrance examination.
Words cannot describe the horror I experienced.
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
Tom isn't dealing with his father's death very well.
Tom cut some branches off the apple tree.
I'm not a fan of that maniac.
The coffee is all gone.
The police arrested me.
What's it doing out here?
Tom is fantastic.
Could you do me a really big favor?
Lock this door behind me.
We were unaware that that was happening.
We spent a week at the beach.
Know yourself.
Tom sneezes every time he's near flowers.
She's at the hotel now.
Tom and I seldom work together.
There's a dog by the door.
Mary isn't as careful as she used to be.
Do you have someplace to stay?
Do you even remember them?
It makes me curious.
Take your hand out of your pocket.
She won't listen to me.
They took me seriously.
What made you say such a stupid thing as that?
Everything is ready now for the party.
Mr. Wilson is angry at Dennis.
I think you'd better tell her.
Everyone loves you.
They sent ambassador Tom Jackson as far away from Washington as they ever could.
I am going to have something to eat.
It keeps getting harder and harder.
I wonder whether Tom will do that today or not.
You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
Tom knew Mary wouldn't be able to do that without any help.
Would you mind if I didn't do that?
I don't recall asking you to do that.

Language reflects the history, customs, and soul of the people that speak it.
I caught Tom.
Tom could replace Mary.
The charge was reduced to manslaughter.
She may not wait any longer.
I called my mother.
Tom waited for Mary in front of the library all morning.
I have been here for many years.
He always wants to have his own way.
I'll step outside.
She comes from the north.
I think that what he says isn't true.
Snap out of it.
There was smegma under his foreskin.
When did you last see my brother?
That's not Tom. It's his brother.
Which is more common?
I have to take off.
Is it OK if I borrow these?
If you want to be slim, follow this diet.
I know that I'm wrong.
Do you like to stay alone?
We'll have to wait several hours.
I'm not being rude.
An orator is made, but a poet is born.
Tom left Australia on October 20th.

By the summer of 1920, the Red Scare was over.
Why didn't you talk to me about it?
Maybe I'm never going to find anyone.
I'm a bit drunk. I think I should stop drinking now.

You've come too early.
I'm waiting to see if it's true.
What kind of oranges do you plant here?
Tom is a big fan of science fiction.
Tom is allergic to strawberries.
Tom seemed gullible.
This system has a built-in protection circuit.
Do you have a cell phone with you?
He wore red pants.
She's not in yet.
I don't want to go outside this afternoon.
I think maybe I can help.
Do you want some cheese?
He is deeply in debt now.
Tom has a broken arm.
I wish she could be here with us.
Tom stooped and picked up the coin.
I missed Tom.
I knew it would be easy.
His vainglory put the Republic at risk.
Keep Tom away from here.
I'm sick of this hot weather.
Who runs faster, Ken or Tony?
Let me show you how it works.
I went to the shop.
Tom told me that he wanted to go to Australia.
Show me how to do it.
You should've done that with Tom.
Tell us everything you know about the problem.
We should teach our kids about the dangers of smoking.
The climate of Canada is cooler than that of Japan.
I added it.
Tom will have to do that for me.

When did you graduate from high school?
It was small.
Tom always seems to be excited.
He cried out from pain.
I want to show her around town.
Tom doesn't trust anyone anymore.
Tom will be thrilled to see you.
Do you hear from her often?
I studied for a while in the afternoon.
That is mine. I don't know where his is.
Educate your children!
I don't want to start anything I can't finish.
Tom wouldn't be crazy enough to do that, would he?
Is there any coffee left?
I'm not leaving Tom alone.
Tom demonstrated how the device worked.
I suppose you know all about it.
You don't have much time left.
Tom and Mary met in Boston three years ago.
Are you sure you're not Ms. Ramirez?
Can you make the deadline?
I treat her like my daughter.
What Tom said shocked everybody.
Sorry for all the typos.
I don't usually do that, but I did yesterday.
Wherever Mary goes, the sheep follows her.

This can resist any criticism.
Stop it or I'll scream!
It was really cold on Monday.
Tom was involved in a fistfight.

It seems that this time I'm the man behind the eight ball.
Tom showed me his garden yesterday.
She is like a beautiful dream.
Tom and Mary said they've been to Boston.

Where are you from, sir? "Japan."
I don't often go there.

My handbag was stolen.
What's the average height of the players?
So, what does all of this mean?
Tom knew Mary was going to be busy.
Take some money just in case you need it.
I remember his face, but I don't remember his name.

That seat is taken.
What did you eat for lunch?
That is a very bad pun.

Will you drink another cup of coffee?
Tom just wants a job.
He's a great coach.
How's that going to help?
Have you spent a lot of time in Boston?

Sami was very determined to do that.
Don't bury your head in the sand.
Tom has just been given another chance.
Tom has lost his student ID.
Tom was never unhappy.
What are you responding to?
What do you expect me to tell Tom?
But do you think people are stupid?
I'm not a genius.
I wasn't annoyed.
That'll depend entirely on them.
I almost lost my wallet.
Tom took forever to get dressed.
These days, it rains frequently.
I'm pretty sure Tom can do that.

The walls have ears.
I didn't answer the question.

I didn't want to do this in the first place.
I'd like to visit Australia.
The truth doesn't always win.
Are you planning to stay up all night?

How did he know my name?
Tom was the first.
He was extraordinarily handsome.
Tom could be at school.
Does Tom know that you're here?
I'm so happy you're back.
You can't speak French, can you?
He told me how to get to the museum.
I'll never forget the first time I saw you.
What do you have to be grateful for?
I lost control.
Look out for cars in crossing the street.
Tom is wary.
I hear someone singing.
I'm surprised Tom didn't come by car.
Sami still considers himself lucky.
Is Tom one of your sons?
Tom left the bar with Mary.
The body of that man still hasn't been found.
We will clarify what is true and what is false.
I chose to ignore the problem.
You promised you wouldn't tell.
Tom used to go to school by bicycle, but now he goes by bus.
Tom no longer teaches French.
Tom said that would happen soon.

Can't we start over?

We've overlooked many important facts.
Women are individuals.
I'm going to stay with you.
There's a cockroach in the bathroom.
I killed them.
I would prefer to stay home rather than go out.
That's the boy I saw yesterday.
I'm afraid that there isn't any coffee left.
She asked me to meet her at the station.
In October, I was in Boston.
Water will evaporate after it is boiled.
Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or a picture or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.
He is a foreigner, and ought to be treated as such.
All Tom cared about was his children.
I don't think Tom would be willing to help us.
It's impolite to stare at people.

Do you have a bright light for reading?
What do you want from us?
Tom and Mary both don't understand French at all.
Tom is not as stupid as he looks.
Tom didn't tell me everything.
Everyone is on vacation.
The building has no fire exit.
I'm going to try to stay up all night.
They come in various shapes.
I know what it feels like.
Tom never flinched.
I think that I'm really not any good at French.
I didn't know them then.
Tom could stop Mary from doing that.
I want you to be real nice to Tom.
None of my children want to go to Boston.
Tom used to speak French better than Mary.
She just laughed it off.
It's what Tom believed.
True friendship is priceless.
Some people say that French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
Do you remember where we first met?
Please don't argue.
I want you out of my life.
I'll boil you the potatoes.
They own a lot of land.
I made my brother go to the station.
Tom told Mary why he wanted to do that.
I wrote down her name so as not to forget it.
I'd like to see you this afternoon.
Evil is everywhere.
This is quite puzzling.
Everyone in my family is very healthy.
What's going on tonight?

I said drop it!
Are you a model?
Is Mr. Al-Obaid here?
Layla lost her money.
Tom has been accused of stealing some bicycles.
All Tom wanted was a little sleep.
Tom hasn't yet replied to my letter.
Stop making fun of me!
I fill my pockets with candy when I go to see the kids.
Either you or he has to attend the meeting.
I can't do anything about that right now.
Do you think something happened to Tom?
A stranger came up and asked me the way to the hospital.
I solved the problem.
I don't think Tom and Mary will need to do that.
There isn't anything Tom isn't afraid of.
Both Tom and Mary could retire if they wanted to.
I heard a noise in the bedroom.
Tom refused to carry Mary's suitcase.
Her story is true.
Sami's incredible story began in Egypt.
I assume that's a joke.
I found the comic book very interesting.
Sooner or later, the truth'll come out.
Get up. It's late.
I came to Toronto at the beginning of June.
Tom will have a great time.
I waited a whole year for that.

Tom may be swimming now.
Tom won't go to school today.
I love rice.
He stuck out his tongue at his teacher.
Tom helped Mary get ready for her interview.
I was annoyed with him for being so late.
I'm going to use rice for my collage.
Tom didn't even smile.
I knew you wouldn't come.
Nobody can do that as well as I can, not even Tom.
Have your parents met your girlfriend yet?
Someone needs to tell Tom what's expected of him.
I don't need to do this, but I enjoy doing it.
Don't tell Tom about what we plan to do next weekend.
I have some homework to finish.
I have a major problem with this.
My shirt is orange.
We're just children.
Do you have any advice for us?
Call your sisters.
How did Tom go to Boston?
Don't leave your things behind.
I don't know who I can trust.
The man to whom I spoke was a German, not an American.
Dan has a lengthy criminal background.
That house looks nice.
There are three buttons.
Last summer, I spent three weeks in Boston.
It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live according to them.
Instantly the girl saw her mother, she burst out crying.
Tom likes swimming more than I do.
All I did was repeat what Tom told me.
I need to hire an accountant.
Give me a clue.
What are we doing for lunch?
Tom seems to be unwilling to testify against Mary.
Tom is someone who can't be trusted.
You aren't going to Bosnia on vacation.
Do you want to spoil the best moment in my life?
If you don't sleep soon, it'll be morning before you know it.
Sami read the Quran from cover to cover.
Mary is a nonvoter.
Her kindness has become a burden to me.
I just wanted you to look at this.
I can't stand that kind of politician.
I still need to finish my homework.
I don't have any money with me.
Layla wanted to be a wife and a mother.
I admire your talent.
Why do you drink until you're this drunk?
How dare you use that tone with me!
Is that going to be a problem for you, too?
Tom climbed out of his car.
You've defeated them.
You forgot your change.

Thirdly, each team leader please report your progress.
I will see to it.
I wish that Tom would help us.
That's a hard problem.
I thought Tom might be sick.
I call her but she doesn't come.
Conditions haven't improved.
Yes, this one is very nice. How much does it cost?
I wish I was faster.
What time did Tom want to do that?
He killed one of his hostages.
It won't clear up.

Tom told Mary to do that, didn't he?
How much is the monthly rate?
Tom did that the way I suggested.
Tom stopped and stared at Mary.
I just didn't want you to worry.
Please, remember those words for the rest of your life.
Don't forget to buy milk.

I don't want Tom to be a soldier.
I've stopped worrying about it.
I found somebody.
Please be gentle.
I wish you all would go home.

Tom walked down the corridor.
We're going to take good care of Tom.
Why don't you keep your eyes open?
We treasure our trees.
I need some sleep.
Do you know where Tom and his friends went?
Hello, John! How are you?
Please turn on the radio.

Do you celebrate the Earth Day?
Tom is courteous.
I'm kind of excited, too.
How do I know if a guy is interested in me?

Look at the price tag.
Let's follow him.

Tom and I are in Boston now.
Don't give up so easily.
What time did you get here?
I find it necessary to be able to say what I feel.
How can we tell?
They wiped out an entire species.
Tom holstered his pistol.
Gold is similar in color to brass.
I have decided to carry on the work.
Don't reckon that he'd lend you some money.

I'll never stop loving you.
I've done that more than most people have.
He came and had dinner with us.
How many more are there?

You're the only one who thinks that's true.

Would you mind telling me one thing?
Tom pays attention to details.
Can Tom do it?
A beautiful woman like you shouldn't be eating alone.
Pitch the ball.
Tom told Mary she didn't have to worry about John anymore.
The orchestra plays nightly the whole night through.
Does the school have a library?
My job is safe.

Flour is the main ingredient in cakes.
You know her, I think.
I talked to Tom's old girlfriend.
Tom isn't neat.
Please give me batteries for a camera.

He ran out of food.
Tom is going to find a way to get it done.
Tom volunteered to help.
Tom readily accepted the offer.
We saw the sun rise above the horizon.
That's what made Tom angry.
She was dressed like a bitch.

Sami did it with the best of intentions.
I almost never get nervous.
I have to be someplace else at 2:30.
Stockings should be of the proper size.
I don't know how to thank you enough.

You know I didn't do that.
I'm considering not doing that.
Oh my God! You're so stupid!

I've crossed the Atlantic several times.

I was trying to be funny.
Tom is probably still miserable.

They were covered in blood.
I need to practice speaking Turkish.
Do you want to eat noodles or rice?
They're dimming the lights. The play is about to begin.
We need a bath.

There is no doubt that I could not do it without your help.
I deliberately did that.

I'm not sure about this at all.
It's fun hanging out with Tom.
Karl suited up and headed out of the space station.
Does it have something to do with Tom?

Tom didn't tell Mary he was already married.
If you don't pay rent, the landlord will evict you.

I had to go home and change.
Can you take this call for me?
We really have to go.
I wasn't doing anything wrong.
Riots broke out in Boston.
We can't accept all of these.
Tom is becoming a problem.
Sami would kill for cash.
The basket was full of apples.
Do you think he would accept my invitation?
Tom told Mary that he'd look into the problem.
Don't forget to pick me up at 6 o'clock tomorrow.
That's quite logical.
He can speak French.
We have some things that we need to talk about.
Tom is grading papers.
Somebody got there before us.
We've got to start somewhere.
Tom doesn't eat pork, does he?
He came all the way from Kyushu to see the Mona Lisa.
I am a French doctor.
That's only happened once before.
Take our picture.
Tom is now on duty.
Let's start over.
You let Tom get away.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is supposed to do.
Today I will not get an email from Mary.
Tom stubbed his toe.
Let's have a party.
What color is your truck?
I don't think it looks bad. It's just not my style.

I'm an optimist by nature.
It's all Tom's doing.
So what happened here?
He will tell her about it when she comes back.
You did something incredibly stupid.
I don't know what Tom looks like.
What's the matter now?
Tom and Mary wanted to open their own restaurants.
He's supposed to be dead.
Sami doesn't know that.
Where is the bathroom?
I can't believe he's single.
I think we have some mice in the attic.
The noisy headphones are that guy's.
Pull over to the side, please.
I went and bought some cream puffs. Do you want any?
Tom is in the back with Mary.
He must be aware of the danger.
Hold the line.

I would like to learn English for work.
Do they really exist?
He has two women in his life.
The room is sunny.
When should we tell them?
Today was a good day, so I'll sleep soundly tonight.
I've tried it and it works like a dream.
Are you sure you don't want to join me?
Why is my blood pressure high?
Tom wants desperately to believe that what Mary said is true.
Tom is running a little behind schedule.
I should've come here by bicycle.
I have to go to work.
Don't let Tom drink any orange juice.
I'm one of the three people who know how to do that.
Tom is chewing something.
There's not enough food.
The police think that Tom's hammer was the murder weapon.
You'll soon be happy.
Tom said that he was really glad Mary did that.
King Arthur's sword Excalibur was forged on the island Avalon.
Tom lives not far from here.
I think it is necessary for them to go there.
There's no entrance fee.
Are you willing to change?
I want a boiled egg.
I've never worked with them.
Do it according to this.
Tom said that he wanted to leave early.
I think the opposite.
I need to know who I have to give this to.
I saw you with a group of men.
Tom did what he had been told.
He's a construction worker.
I've just finished my homework.
This could take a long time.
As usual, he was the last to arrive at the theater.
He was a jihadist.
You burned the French fries.
A ferry carrying hundreds of high school students sank in South Korea.
Can you recommend anything?
You can't blame her for what she did.
Write to her.
Don't slurp.
I wish you'd told that the meeting was going to start at 2:30.
Tom doesn't care how Mary dresses.
I'm not as young as I used to be.
I thought you were going to quit.
It's a cautionary tale.
Convenience stores and supermarkets can sell medicine since 2009.
There are errors in this phone bill.
Because I want to be a translator.
We went out for a walk after breakfast.
There's a big fly on the ceiling.
Tom wondered if Mary could understand French.
I need to get a hold of him.
If you don't want to go to that party, you don't have to.
Tom has a square jaw.
I feel good about it.
It doesn't bother me much.
How could Tom be so cruel?
I don't have time to help them.
She returned quickly.
You should learn not to limit your options.
I haven't been there in years.
Does Tom like French?
I brought Tom here on Monday.
Have you ever been to Nara?
Tom still can't swim very well.
Tom is almost fully dressed.
You're the one who doesn't understand.
The swallow is swift in flight.
I want to correct this article.
Tom hates my dog.
Tom should have known better than to kiss Mary in public.
Don't pay any attention to them at all.
Let's ditch him.
Can you prove Tom didn't do that?
Watch out for her.
I have to be in Boston tomorrow.
Who is the author of this story?
You're a wanker.
Tom is a snob.
I've heard that Tom is now studying French.
I should've told Tom that I couldn't understand French.
Let's go for a coffee.
I painted the roof light blue.
Tom told me not to worry.
The audience groaned at some of Tom's puns.
It's a pity you didn't know more about Tom.
I don't think people should make a mountain of a mole hill.
I don't like apples. All of them seem tasteless to me.
Sami was slow.
He misled you.
Aren't you supposed to be in school right now?
I saw Tom before he saw me.
I wasn't surprised Tom did that.
Tom has been helping Mary with her homework.
It's very rude of you to say a thing like that.
Sami worked for a bank.
You said you were going to handle it.
My house is near Tokyo Tower.
Tom is a renowned chef.
By the way, how many of you keep diaries?
He was sitting and reading a book.
I'm in Boston this week.
Somebody's watching us.
It's too ugly.
Tom will probably be eating now.
I want the same dictionary as you have.
I had no idea where to go.
It appears to be a wedding.
She went outside to get a breath of fresh air.
I'm sure Tom will come back as soon as he realizes he left his briefcase here.
I won't have to go there by myself.
The party decorations were colorful.
When do you think you'll see Tom again?
We were all present at the conference.
She has absolutely no enemies.
Was Tom hurt?
We struggled with it for a while.
Kim was two years senior to him.
Tom told me to run.
Don't say stupid things!
Don't you want to walk again?
If it had not been for his timely hit, our team would have lost the game.
You don't remember Tom, do you?
You don't like me.
He likes to eat raw carrots.
Blue suits you well.
Tom is too young to travel alone.
Everything's been easy for us.
I thought maybe you'd have an idea.
Diana gasped.
I'm easy to please.
Do you think Tom is going to be here this afternoon?
Tom plans to leave Boston next year.
Can you survive on your salary?
Your family must be very nice.
Tom kept checking his watch.
This sentence has five words.
My brother watches television.
It's sufficient.
Tom realized Mary had to help John do that.
Perhaps I should talk to her.
Tom seemed harmless.
Dan has been bullying me for months.
The cat was unimpressed.
Tom is pretty dependable, isn't he?
There'll be no one in the house.
Tom is doing much better.
I got back into my car.
What's the difference between fermentation and putrescence?
I can't finish painting this house in one day.
I suspect Tom and Mary have to do that.
I was pretty nervous.
Does Tom still like jazz?
Tom and Mary were very lucky.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if you left early.
Tom is a lot like you.
It's like a dream.
He cannot answer their questions.
He avoided her eyes.
I don't have anything else I want to say.
Tom would've succeeded if he'd worked harder.
Although he is very old, he is strong.
We used to play musical chairs in elementary school.
This bus stops at all railway crossings.
We should sort the students' names alphabetically.
We reached school at eight-thirty.
How lucky can one be?
Tom is responsible for it.
I see how you did that.
I need to talk to him alone.
Please put a stop to this nonsense.
Stop picking your nose.
It's just a beer.
If current trends continue, the language will likely die in the near future.
I don't want to lose Fadil all over again.
It's a godsend.
Tom doesn't like to speak French.
Tom will be at work Monday.
What time does the post office close?
Even though I wasn't planning to do that, I ended up doing it.
The news caused alarm throughout the village.
We just broke up.
Is it all wrong?
I would like you to rely on me.
That should only take me a few minutes.
We have to tell Tom.
You see a white building at the foot of the hill.
Betty seemed surprised at the news.
Tom just admitted he made a mistake.
He is a kind man at heart.
We could do something big.
We will survive with God's help!
Finally, he achieved his goal.
He asked his friends for help.
Tom was having a good day in his new home.
Keep your hands clean.
I'm scared Tom is going to kill me.
Tom wondered what his life would have been like if he had married Mary.
When Tom entered the room, Mary stopped talking.
My family have lived here for twenty years.
I can help you through this.
I couldn't possibly go there unless you went with me.
I don't deserve to be treated like that.
I burned myself yesterday.
That's outside my area of expertise.
Where can dollars be exchanged for pounds?
I promise I'll wait for you.
Two teas and a coffee, please.
Wait for me here and don't go anywhere.
Please keep it secret.
How can you say that to me?
They were nice.
What do we do for a living?
There's no connection between the two things.
Will you and Randy join us?
You can study here.
Tom said that Mary was going camping next weekend.
When do you intend to eat?
She was the most beautiful girl on the beach.
This one belongs to Tom.
She chuckled.
If Tom ran for president, I'd vote for him.
Tom moved his cursor.
Tom doesn't call me anymore.
How can I pay?
I believe in God.
I won't eat that.
Tom never speaks French.
They said they're bored.
Does anything exciting ever happen around here?
Call it anything you want.
Please stop yelling.
He is always kind to animals.
Tom went instead of his dad.
We may not have everything we want, but we have everything we need.
It may be more difficult than you think it'll be.
You don't really want that, do you?
I don't think Layla was a runaway.
Do your parents still live in Germany?
I had an anxiety attack.
Get a job, you hippie!
I'll call you when it's done.
I never wanted this, either.
The farmer entered the pigsty.
Tom became homeless.
Tom didn't want to miss anything.
You'll die in jail.
How many brothers and sisters does Tom have?
Tom did that because Mary told him to.
When did you realize Tom didn't like it here?
This surprised many people.
Jessie accepted the invitation at once.
Eventually you'll have to tell Tom.
My uncle's on a business trip to Aomori tomorrow.
He is rotten to the core.
What could've happened to him?
This clock is rarely rung.
I haven't been feeling like myself since last month.
How long does Tony run every day?
This is for Scotland, not for Sparta.
Tom is a notary.
Tom tried the coat on to see if it would fit.
Tom has been dating Mary.
I have a surprise for you, sweetheart.
Tom's family rarely eats together.
Do you think that's a bad thing?
Tom stopped and looked at me.
Tom said Mary wouldn't likely have to do that.
He sat in Zen meditation.
Can you see anyone?
I used to jog every day.
That's especially true in Boston.
The cost of building the railroad was very high.
I want with you to conquer the world but I feel we can't go too far.
Tom doesn't understand a word of French.
I know what they want me to do.
Mary didn't wash her hair.
How long will it be?
Tom said he thought he had to speak French.
We think you're in danger.
She felt like taking a walk.
We canoed downstream.
Is everything ready?
This song is known to everyone.
You almost gave me a heart attack.
I know that I'm not ready.
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
Let's just get rid of her.
Do you want to see something funny?
Shopping malls are popular among teenagers.
Tom never saw Mary.
Don't interrupt me while I am talking.
I know why Tom is afraid.
Our trip to Africa has become a catastrophe.
Tom started crying again.
Everyone can live peacefully.
Bill can speak Japanese a little.
Tom walks his dog every morning.
You did a great job.
I think those are the best.
Aren't you registered to vote?
Is there any proof?
Tom took a picture of a squirrel while it was eating a nut.
I'm glad to hear Tom is out of danger.
Tom and Mary agreed to work together.
I got this bicycle for nothing.
We have different goals.
Do you have an idea of where he might be?
Tom is well aware of the odds.
Nobody asked me.
I knew that guy wasn't one of us.
Please wait five minutes.
This used to be a parking lot.
Why don't you come earlier?
You should be good to your neighbors.
The blood of heroes flows in my veins.
We already know you did it.
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
I will never forget their warm hands.
I make a point of being punctual.
Cities are usually much more polluted than villages.
She opened the window, even though I told her not to.
Tom meant what he said.
I don't remember where you work.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
My team is always losing.
I am afraid I'll be a burden to you.
I'll give it to her.
You have to be more specific than that.
Tom says that Mary winked at him.
The place is not accessible by land.
I'm sure Tom has other skills.
Aren't you Mr. Ogawa? "Yes, I am. Can I help you?"
I don't think you're ready.
Why was it done?
Tom isn't likely to want to do that with us.
I'm really into soccer.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm afraid of the policemen.
Why won't you let me see them?
Let's see what fate has prescribed.
Let's find out what Tom needs us to do.
Tom wants to play.
I talked to Tom last night.
I don't have enough money to pay for the product in cash.
Tom seemed a little distracted.
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you.
The police have been following me.
Tom is roughly the same age as I am.
Tom can sleep on the couch.
Sami asked Layla to leave.
Turn on, tune in, drop out.
Tell Tom that he needs to apologize to Mary.
She doesn't know how to read or write.
We have some questions for you.
It is effective against bacterial infections.
He killed the girl in cold blood just to get the money.
Tom doesn't know how to cook pasta.
Why don't you want to do this?
The lion ate the rabbit in one bite.
The important thing is to have your own hobby.
Follow your instincts.
I understand French better than I can speak it.
Is this the first time you've had this kind of problem?
Tom might need to speak French.
These "friends" are a bad influence on you.
Tom isn't satisfied with that.
Who broke this chair?
Tom put the key in the ignition.
Sami loved his family with a passion.
Sami started a new affair.
You look depressed.
How are you related to Tom?
Please tell Tom he should do that.
I've been watching them.
Tom says I speak too fast.
Everything is going to be different now.
Labelling speech as hate speech is a way to limit free speech by means of social pressure.
Tom used to be talkative.
Tom lost all hope.
I had to lie to her.
Tell me what you're crying about.
What is the difference between raster and vector graphics?
What do you want from them?
Tom knew who Mary was going to go to Boston with.
She solved a case.
Tom thought Mary was right.
Everyone can see it now.
The escaped prisoners are considered armed and dangerous.
Do you have a hoe I could borrow?
I never thought I'd want more.
She speaks English with an odd accent.
Friendship is a plant which must be often watered.
Tom was just about to do that.
Maybe that's a good idea.
I'm going to find out who did this.
Tom said the meeting went well.
He is influential.
I thought he was stupid.
This city is famous for its beautiful park.
Everyone in the room was stunned by what happened.
I have no idea who might've broken the window.
I'd better take you home.
If it rains tomorrow, I won't go on a picnic.
I feel better today than yesterday.
Let Tom stay home.
Tom signed up a long time ago.
Shut up and do as you're told.
He has little confidence in himself.
She knows how to speak Spanish.
Everybody here but Tom has done that.
I knew you wouldn't lose.
Where is Tom? "I don't know. Maybe he's dead."
Tom admitted his guilt.
All aboard!
At the North Pole, there are no penguins.
This sentence doesn't exist.
It will not stay this way.
I want you to sing the song.
How exactly will this help us?
Tom won't agree to a divorce.
I know it's wrong.
The cat escaped from being hit by the car.
Tom doesn't smoke or drink.
The Prime Minister met with the press.
The coins are metal.
That's all I live for.
Are you still looking for your key?
I wasn't raised that way.
Some companies guarantee their workers a job for life.
This tire doesn't have enough air in it.

Tom took out his camera and started taking pictures.
They made the pilot fly the Navy helicopter.
We weren't looking for them.

I didn't understand the question.
Tom should've been doing that.
She always buys expensive clothes.

Tom might've done the same thing.
I don't like cold weather.
Tom wondered what he should say.
You haven't told her, have you?
What'll happen to him?
Tom liked to listen to Mary play the piano.
Don't put the table so close to the wall.
Nothing is likely to be more effective than this.

Good night and sleep tight!
Unless it rains, I will go, too.
It's almost October.

Tom said Mary was likely to be bored.
You too, my son.
We are going to hold a farewell party for him.
Give me a sip of your drink.
Tom is crazy about you.
I just wanted to help.
I didn't deserve the punishment I got.
Do you wish you'd done that sooner?
We'll climb the mountain if it's fine tomorrow.
You don't speak English in your home.
You trust me, don't you?
I got hit by a car.

He met a pretty brunette at the evening party.

I'll tell you all about it when I get home.
I've seen this.
It will be rather difficult for him.
I'm going to be back in an hour.
Tom can't defeat me.
They didn't know what was happening to them.
Are you still studying?
We should be safe in our homes.
Tom said I was incompetent.
I thought Tom was here.
They often help each other.
I know that Tom is retired.
I should have followed Tom's advice.
It doesn't look good.
It's very noisy here.
I wish I had a wife as good-looking as yours.
I don't ride my bicycle anymore.
I just don't have much time.
It will be very hard.
Tom is making breakfast now.

You're welcome to join me.

I feel like I've known him forever.
I experienced it firsthand.
Lucky, weren't you?
Could you hold on for just a second?
My watch was stolen last night.
We don't have any cream.
I won't do that for you.
I know that Tom is bluffing.

Tom looked around the room, but couldn't see Mary.
Please serve the guests some coffee, dear.
I hope we never have to do that again.

I think we got it fixed.
I never see her in my dreams.
We are sitting in the same boat.
Please tell Tom I was doing nothing wrong.

I've already told Tom that I don't want to do that.

I can't fix every problem.
How will you stop them?
Do you think I'm kidding?
I don't like the ocean.
I'm trying to cheer you up.
Sami should talk to Layla's brother.
Tom used to drink beer.
We all want answers.

You know what it's like.
The sky had become threatening before I got to the station.
Leave Tom and Mary alone.

They arrived on flight 201.
Tom wanted Mary to stay, but she left.
Have you put on weight?
I just wanted to see if you knew.
Tom bet me fifty dollars that he could eat more hot dogs than I could.
Ten years ago his theory would not have been generally accepted.

She didn't appear to recognize him.
The moment I saw him, I knew he was angry.
Thank you for the warning.
Many soldiers were killed here.
I can't quite figure out what that chord around 1:58 is. Can somebody help me out?

I know some dirty jokes, but I never tell them.
Tom didn't want anyone else to know.
The car continued to pick up speed.
I just thought I might be able to help.
I'll try to change their minds.
Tom always gets up at 6:30.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but I did overhear you.
Instead of going ashore, we stayed on the ship.
She has brown shoes.
It's not illegal to do that here.
Would you buy that?

Put your hands on the car.
Tom is right outside.
I'm not supposed to talk to anyone about this.
I'm just looking out for him.
That's a very pretty blouse.
Tom takes offense at the slightest thing.
We might not have a choice.
Since my brother died suddenly two years ago, my sister-in-law has valiantly kept going the small jewellery store he left her.
And are you happy now?
Tom thought Mary was very rude.
Life is often compared to a voyage.
You people are insane.
Older men are usually very wise.
Tom didn't tell me about this place.
I would prefer to go out than stay in.
I didn't feel cold.
You're a good painter.

OK, take your blindfold off.
Don't show your cards.

You're fat enough as it is.
This is taking us too long.
Are you here alone?
Tom is clueless.
Is your homework done?
I don't have a stamp collection, but I have a Japanese postcard collection that I could use as an excuse to invite him.
It's rare to find big yards in Japan.
Don't park your car here.
They know what happened.
Please give me something cold.
Tom said we ought to do this more often.
Washington was worried.
Where is the store?
I lost that argument.
You have time.
Hold on a second, I'll be right back. Don't hang up!
Layla and Sami met at a shopping mall.
They heard a noise.

I need you to urinate in this cup.
He is by no means kind.
Tom isn't as tough as he seems.
Iron is a useful metal.
I don't know what to tell Tom.
I want to have a career before I get married.
That's your car.
Don't you have a boyfriend?
Just give me another minute.
Don't tell me: you lost the keys again. "I did not!" "So where are they?" "Um... I'll get back to you on that."
Tom isn't himself.
He fell asleep right away.
We handle that as well.
Construction should start in October.
It's starting to get cold here.
I have a guest.
Tom poked his finger up through the hole in the wall.
They made us work all day.
Come on, you can do it.

Thanks for coming so quickly.
Please put on your shoes.

Do you really think that you're fooling anybody?
The children are celebrating the boy's birthday.

Tom asked us to sit down.
Did somebody hit you?
The picture is colorful in contrast with this one.
Aren't you planning to stay here for a while?
Tom loves to lie in the grass on a sunny day.
Sooner or later, every parent has to have a talk with their children about the birds and the bees.
Tom is not overly friendly.
I know you don't care.
How many donuts do you want?
Having made an unwavering decision, he started to make plans to fulfill his dreams.
Tom doesn't want to pay in cash.
After the wind has stopped, let's sail the boat off to the open sea.
Where will we be going?
Tom wanted to get his money's worth.
I don't usually wear lipstick.
I must've forgotten.
Our problems are nothing compared to Tom's.
Tom doesn't think that Mary is a nurse.
Tom tried to hide his smile.
It doesn't exist.
