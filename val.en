Tom's unwillingness to help surprised Mary.
Tom agreed with everything Mary said.
I didn't promise anybody anything.
We need hats.
Tom is on the phone right now.
You're out of line, Tom.
Tom is going to handle that.
It hasn't been that long.
Tom said he didn't plan to be there.
She applied to the chief for a vacation.
Is it OK if I open a can?
I know Tom is thin.
Tom knew that Mary was dead.
Tom shot Mary in the knee before he blew her brains out.
This is the latest fashion.
Let's just hang around here for a while.
Tom is looking for a new job.
This is as good as any.
Tom chopped down the tree.
You have to take that into account.
I'm sure that he'll come on time.
It's been a long time since I've worn a tie.
Tom is available tonight.
Tom is on a diet.
I've never actually been here before.
If two past lovers can remain friends, it's either because they are still in love, or they never were.
Tom says he's on his way back home.
The meat is raw.
You're sick. You have to rest.
She allegedly killed him.
I can't believe Tom's over thirty.
I spend too much time in front of my computer.
I know a girl who speaks English well.
Tom came to my defense.
Tom is a twin.
Now he is eating dinner.
I knew I could do it.
He has an annoying voice.
That gives us hope.
Tom gave me permission to go.
How can Tom win?

One man's loss is another man's gain.
I felt Tom's forehead.
Tom doesn't like summer. He says it's too hot.
How much money does he make a month?
We had a short vacation in February.
You can come out now.
I'll have to try another way.
That was sensible.
We may need to live in Boston for a few years.
Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship was one of the most violent of the century.
Tom is supposed to be asleep.
He sells vegetables.
I can feel everything you feel.
Tom signed a pledge.
Nothing can stop Tom from doing that.
We'll probably never know why Tom killed himself.
Ms. Ionescu, I'd like to ask you something.
Tom has a skin condition.
You have to continue to study.
Anybody who says that is a liar.
Tom and Mary are both good students.
Tom applied a drying agent to his weeping wound.
To lose weight, you must cut back on sweets.
You guys are always so busy.
Do we have to keep talking about this?
Layla had a son.
Is she your mom?
He often eats out on Saturday nights.
Doesn't Tom look handsome?
Maybe you should call them.
Is there anything we need to do before this afternoon's meeting?
Only two people did that.
She feared cancer would kill her husband before their great-grandson was born.
That really made sense.
We're all competitive, actually.
What's this street called?
It seemed like the only rational thing to do.
I despise you.
The fruit tastes sweet.
Please give me some advice.
Do you think Tom will still be able to do that after the operation?
My wife loves apple pie.
The doctor is examining him right now.
It's good to talk to you.
It sounds like Tom is in trouble again.
Why did you think you had to do that?
Kelly, watch the stars!
I never did anything like that to Tom.
He has several buyers for the property.
Does Tom really want us to do that?
I haven't seen her for a while.
You sent a letter from Algeria.
I saw Tom kissing Mary behind the barn.
We didn't talk in the car.

This isn't your fault.
Tom looked into the murky water.
The worst thing about winter is the snow.
Kalman found a spot to set up camp by the river.
We got a standing ovation.
You cannot defect to another country unless you can travel there.

Can I add you on Facebook?
I don't want to be on Tom's team.
What were you doing in the attic?
Janos loves his wife.
He is proficient in Farsi.
Is this the key you are looking for?
I pay in cash.
Young people used to look down on the rules of society.
Tom certainly doesn't have the money he used to.
You're seeing someone else, aren't you?
Give me one good reason I should do that.
I kissed her on her forehead.
His childhood was harsh.
He was disappointed that his expectations were not met.
She was not sure what to do.
Tom is very good with his hands.
We don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.
I won't beg you.
Tom is in the laboratory now.
I'll take back what I said.
Tom was rude and obnoxious.
Can you tell me when Tom will be back?
Throw away everything.
Is that supposed to be a question?
I wish I hadn't lent Tom my car.
I didn't know that you couldn't drive.
I have to ask her first.
Is this good enough for you?
My keyboard does not work well.
He sat down and read while his wife was cooking by the fire.
She wishes to become a doctor.
Well, OK, Willie finally agreed.
Let us not ban everything we disagree with.
Tom knows who told Mary to do that.
Please remember to mail this letter on your way to school.
Tom got Mary to dance.
I was just trying to stop the fight.
That's not a pencil.
What would Tom say if he were here?
You never told me your name.
Time and circumstances bring wisdom.
You're a good drummer.
Where did you call them?
Tom has been sick for a week.
Tom turned pale with fright.
We went to see the Museum of Humankind, but it is closed on Tuesdays.
What ties a people together?
Mary doesn't feel like she's smart enough.
I love art.
We all jumped into the water at the same time.
Tom made the comment so offhandedly that at first it seemed unimportant, but then I saw the tension in his face and his body language and it quickly became clear that it really meant the world to him.
Tom looks like he's sure.
I have the solution.
How can I lose weight safely?
I'm a crusader.
Where are they living now?

A fortune-teller read my hand.
My shoelaces came undone.
It's a risk we need to take.
Can you do a headstand?
You've got to see Tom.

Is there somebody here who speaks French?
Do not give the children any cold milk!
Tom almost pushed the wrong button.
I want to eat Chinese food.
He continued the experiment.
Tom speaks French better than you might expect.
A good man is hard to find.
The crown is the top of the head.
Please don't tell Tom where I am.
She seems to have known the secret.
I don't have a lot of work, but it's enough to keep me in the office this week.
I'm going to call for help.
Can you remember the time we visited Tom when he was still a teenager?
You have to believe me, Fadil.
The cat is licking itself.
I will go swimming tomorrow.
I just thank God that I'm free.
We've been spotted.
Tom said he doesn't know how to speak French.
Tom said he didn't believe in ghosts.
Take some time.
She has many handkerchiefs.
What do you think about your eggs?
She doesn't want you to know.
I'm standing under a tree.
He is too tired to study.
Looking back at 2010, I think I wasted too much time.
Our company has over 300 employees.
Please bring me eggs.
I killed the rat with a stick.
Can I do that tomorrow?
Tom's new book is about Mary.
Dan said Linda hadn't come home the night before.
I swim almost every day in the summer.
Let me make something perfectly clear.
You must stick to your promise.
I can't guarantee the outcome.
Nobody knows why he turns down my help.
This is the most beautiful song I've ever heard.
We could see the summit of a mountain twenty miles away.
I don't know how to swim.
Try not to panic.
They said they were unhappy.
Tom created a website for Mary.
Shouldn't you be at work now?
We're closer than we've ever been.
Did it hurt when you fell? "You bet."
You'll be staying with Tom and me.
If we leave now, we should make it.
You looked calm.
You make me sick and I don't wanna see you anymore.
Tom's in heaven now.
I know that Tom is a lot smarter than I am.
In Germany ghosts don't pay taxes.
Tom and I have a plan.
Tom went to the window to get a better look at what was happening.
Can't you stay a while longer?
Tom acted like he owned the place.
I didn't expect to be so successful.
Tom and Mary don't want to ask John to help them.
How much are we short?
Don't throw away your chance.
No one but Tom left early.
Tom is going to make mistakes just like everybody else does.
People should have realistic expectations.
I don't have a car anymore.
Layla was raped by Sami.
There's beer in the fridge.
Lots of girls like Tom.
That's her boyfriend.
Why do rules exist?
Tom played basketball.
Nobody predicted this would happen.
You're so talented.
We won't be back here again until next year.
Tom is lucky that we helped him.
They wouldn't allow me to say anything at the meeting.
Why is Tom so angry?
We love our customers.
Tom didn't have enough money to buy the guitar he wanted, so he bought a cheaper one.
Did Tom say what happened exactly?
Was he Tom?
It was obvious that he was trying to get her attention.
Tom won't be home this weekend.
I'm running out of energy.
The Swiss Franc is soaring.
The cat plays a game, but the mouse dies.
She's always grumbling.
It's a very pressing matter.
Stefan didn't want to call.
Sami died in June of 1996.
There's nothing new to report.
That situation is changing.
Let's call them.
Tom put the fire out by dumping a bucket of water on it.
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
Tom isn't going to leave Mary here by herself.
The research institute was established in the late 1960s.
Tom said he was finished.
It's very impolite of you to decline her invitation.
Tom likes knitting too.
Please don't make us do anything else.
Did you take him back to your apartment?
Tom and Mary are working nearby.
I really would like to meet another Esperantist some day...
The train is bound for London.
This may take me a while.
This is a chair.
Now, exactly how much do you want?
Do you have anything for me?
The volcanos here are active.
The teacher was surrounded by her students.
I don't think I'm going to make it.
Edward Everett did not agree with Lincoln.
What were you doing at the time of her death?
Let me try to talk to her.
He said he'd never leave his wife.
They are entirely contrasting opinions.
He certainly is smart.
My grandfather was a soldier in the war.
What are you going to do tonight?
The seeing-eye dog helps the blind man to cross the street.
Isn't that obvious?
His eyes are blue.
That's a strange idea.
Be quiet and listen!
Tax season is a very busy time of year for accountants.
Tom is busier than he's ever been.
They will paint the fence tomorrow.
What do you think this sentence means?
Let's finish the job.
You'll forget about me someday.
Do you actually believe this?
Tom has to have everything his own way.
Tom has gone to get a haircut, but he should be back soon.
Does Tom know my name?
We appreciate your hard work.
I'm quite certain Tom did that on purpose.
This makes me happy.
I like my life.
There's a laundromat in the basement of our apartment building.
We met in Europe a few years ago.
Tom is still sick, isn't he?
It's getting hot in here.
Thanks for meeting me.
Tom is in hot water.
You're contradicting yourself, aren't you?
Tom will be there to meet you.
Somebody killed Tom today.
Don't you want children?
Fadil was a model student.
I made a doll for Mary.
I know that Tom died.
The mouse ran and the cat ran after him.
I was hoping you'd consider my request.
I only drink on weekends.
I have done all of my homework and I'd like to take a short break.
Tom headed back to the office.
He'll go to hospital.
Sami had seven dollars in cash.
You won't be able to beat Tom.
That company produces microchips.
The question whether we should go or stay comes next.
The young man's face became even redder.
I didn't think Tom was careless.
You're the only one who didn't understand the irony of what I said.
That may be unaffordable.
We're not letting anyone go.
We should substitute margarine for butter for our health.
I gave a new bicycle to my sister.
Tom can't go with us tomorrow.
Thanks to all of you.
I'm the master of my fate.
Tom has left me.
Tom thinks Mary will be unimpressed.
When can you start?
You're not my wife.
I couldn't tell you who that was.
Is there any need for me to go there?
Many of the children had no clothes on.
He fell down on the floor.
Mary, we're your friends. You can tell us.
Man is the only animal that can laugh.
We rented a movie.
I closed it.
Tom should've told me the truth.
I don't like Tom anymore.
Mary has done it.
I told you the truth.
He will have dinner.
We don't want people like you in our town.
I knew Tom would cry.
Now do you see?
I'm supposed to speak French in the office.
Autumn is almost here.
My, those are some very large hands you have.
She has five older brothers.
I promise never do that again.
Did you apologize to her?
Tom is modest, isn't he?
Can they handle the pressure?
What's the purpose of your visit? "I'm a tourist."
I have no time to do my homework.
On arriving in Tokyo, I wrote her a letter.
I never called Tom an idiot.
Don't call him an idiot.
We didn't need to take those risks.
Why don't you go get them?
Your keyboard needs replacing.
Don't make me stand here.
I'd like to see that in black and white.
Mary is my sister-in-law.
That's just the way he likes it.
She was pleased with the new dress.
Tom is lucky to be alive.
I missed supper.
All four of the boys didn't have alibis.
I didn't get home until after dark yesterday.
I need to be on my own for a while.
Open the bottle.
I got married again.
Tomorrow I'll go and play football.
Tom folded an origami crane.
Tom is always polite, isn't he?
They both left.
Tom wasn't safe.
He is convinced that they will vote in favour of Mr Jones.
Tom and I apologized to each other.
Tom didn't obey me.
I am sending a copy of my letter to you.
Let's get back to the ship.
You opened the wrong box.
That's a very sad situation.
Your arm's broken.
Mary is a weird dudette.
He carried the box upstairs.
Things aren't always as they appear.
Please save my place.
Who could do that?
Tom got there first.
I will deal with it tomorrow.
We didn't do much yesterday.
I prefer drinking coffee to drinking tea.
Of course I did that.
The traffic signal is green.
Tom is really greedy.
Why would I hurt you?
Tom laughed at my jokes.
I told Tom what happened.
Tom is very, very busy.
Do you think I'm doing the right thing?
Tom and Mary just wanted to dance with each other all evening.
Give me my crutches!
I felt a sharp pain in my stomach.
Politicians often skirt around the truth and don't give direct answers to questions.
I don't yet know the truth.
My son has always been very independent.
During happy hour, all drinks are half price.
Tom told me he told you.
The two brothers died.
Tom is the father.
That's what's going on.
We haven't laid off any employees yet.
This company owes its success to him.
Without your help, Tom doesn't have a chance.
We know that we are all people of one world.
I want a sword like this!
I think you ought to get a little sleep.
Firms will soon be looking for new solutions.
I'm learning Burmese.
You had better not sit up so late.
Tom is young and energetic.
My teacher's name is Tom Jackson.
Mary said she wouldn't be able to do that in three hours.
I sleep in the nude.
Tom looked.
I would rather not talk about it.
Did Tom talk about it?
I'm playing tennis tomorrow.
Where can we find food to feed these hungry people?
He was cheated.
It's time to feed the baby.
I'm taking a walk.
Tom is a close friend of Mary's.
The question is who will go there for Tom.
You pay her well, don't you?
I thought that you would recognize Tom.
Tom wanted Mary to marry him.
If she had told me the truth, I wouldn't be angry.
Tom isn't a blackmailer.
Sami planned every detail in advance.
Tom just found out that he has to move to Boston.
We'll make the decision for you.
I think Tom should go home.
Do you have any regional dishes?
Tom has been in and out of mental hospitals most of his life.
Are you sure about all this?
I can't help you right now.
Tom certainly is qualified for the job.
Tom wanted Mary to learn French.
How many days will Tom be here?
When was the last time you saw Tom smile?
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
Tom doesn't treat Mary very nicely.
Tsk tsk.
Over three thousand people attended the concert.
Tom is in love with another woman.
I would go at 10.
Tom usually uses credit cards instead of cash.
My house is on the outskirts of the city.
Don't sleep with the windows open.
Did you really think Tom would do that?
I don't see any bruises.
Tom is probably going to be fascinated by that.
Layla can't tell.
The situation there was critical.
Tom bought a book about cameras.
She stands out from the rest.
Tom and Mary were both very concerned.
Tom wondered how Mary ate so much.
Negotiations are still going on.
You need to make a real change.
At least I'll die happy.
Who's laughing?
Tom wasn't pleased, but Mary was.
You need to leave here right now.
Someone is playing the piano.
I wouldn't be here today without you.
She always dresses very simply.
Iranian people are peace loving.
Is it possible to get there on foot?
Mary doesn't let her sister borrow her clothes.
I don't understand Christmas, said Charlie Brown.
There are many rare fish at the aquarium.
I think that you ought to apologize to her.
Has he arrived already?
I'll go through both the good times and the bad with you.
He did the best he could.
Why don't you go talk to Tom?
Tom and Mary were finally alone.
I'll be going.
We will continue the discussion.
I'm pretty sure that Tom doesn't like me.
What's it look like to you?
I cannot hold the horse.
Can I borrow your scissors?
There's a bus stop there.
I don't think it'll snow tomorrow.
He would have succeeded.
I don't want you to worry.
He misses his father.
Tom said Mary has been to Australia.
I wish things could've happened differently.
I want to know more about him.
Where did you give them?
The mayor addressed the general public.
Tom should've told Mary what he had done.
It is very cold here all the year round.
There are alternatives.
I've quit smoking.
Tom will probably be punctual.
It is already occupied.
What if I told you I really want to be a teacher?
Does Tom do this every day?
I think doing that was fun.
We need to colonize Mars.
Remember Lockerbie!
I heard a song called "Apologize" on the radio.
When we hear of a divorce we assume that it was caused by the inability of those two people to agree upon fundamentals.
What a foolish suggestion!
The children rolled down the hill.
Who told you to kill Tom?
This television is very heavy.
Don't take your mask off.
It's all been written.
I will need some help.
Tom got into trouble with the Milieu in France.
This place isn't convenient to public transportation.
I haven't seen Tom do that.
Just turn this handle.
Did you get enough to eat?
We don't fight for trendy clothes, we fight for justice.
Is there anybody you want me to call?
We enjoyed watching a circus parade.
Do you think that Tom would teach French to my children?
We like our apartment.
I don’t feel well. Where is the office of the nearest doctor?
I told you to leave it in the car.
She got her belly button pierced.
We cut trees with an axe.
The Celtic languages are in decline.
Bring me the newspaper.
I advised Tom to talk to a lawyer.
Tom is pretty heavy.
Why are you hiding from Tom?
That was disgusting.
Tom and Mary seem to really want to kiss.
What did Tom write about?
Take your hand off my neck.
I'll leave the decision to you.
Tom knows why Mary isn't here.
I kind of like Tom, too.
Where is my Kabyle dress?
The audience was excited at the game.
I haven't heard this song in a while.
Can you help me do this?
She probably likes you.
I find her appearance attractive.
Do you think this is normal?
You must think by yourselves.
I worry about that.
We need your help finding them.
Janos was hoping to move to Algiers.
My headache stopped.
She has a roll.
I'll tell you what's wrong.
Boston is the largest city I've ever visited.
Both Tom and Mary went to the concert.
If you need me to do that, I will.
Tom moved out of his father's house.

They talked politics.
Everything's returning to normal.
Tell him.
Don't overthink it.
Tom sent Christmas presents to us.
Tom said he thought he could pass the test.
The valuables are in the bank's safekeeping.
There's no point in denying it anymore.
Try not to make any noise.
There was a flag at the top of the pole.
The fans have been amazing.
They claim they're Canadians.
I come here every year.
I got those pictures you asked me to take.
He is always right.
I don't think I'll go to Boston.
Mars will be our next destination.
Tom spoke with Mary on the phone this morning.
Tractors replaced horses and mules.
Can you copy this for me?
Tom's disappointment was obvious.
You know how serious things are, don't you?
It appears that you are not paying attention to me.
That's one of my favorite expressions.
One of the most urgent challenges of our time is climate change.
I just bought the latest version of this MP3 player.
You were about to say something.
I acted without thinking.
Tom didn't even thank Mary for cooking dinner.
Houari Boumediene was Algeria's president until his death in 1978.
She held out her hand and I shook it.
Let in some fresh air.
Does Tom still work out?
Damn! I forgot to buy rice.
I didn't pretend to be your friend.
Can't you and Tom stay a little longer?
I'll see you this evening.
Shakespeare's plays are full of anachronisms.
Tom noticed how much weight Mary had put on.
I was so busy today that I didn't have time to eat lunch.
Tom wasn't overly optimistic.
Did you know that Tom only had one leg?
I sure hope that Tom doesn't win.
Who'll pay for that?
Tom told me to be there by 2:30.
Remain alert.
Mary likes all vegetables except cabbage.
Traffic on this road has been disrupted due to flooding.
Tom ran and ran, until at last he saw the telephone booth.
Tom and Mary had a romantic dinner to celebrate the first anniversary of their being together.

Unfortunately this is real.
We don't have very much food.

Everyone already knows anyway.

How about a cup of hot coffee?
The mother was exhausted.
I installed some new software yesterday on my computer.
Am I being foolish?
Fadil chose to reveal the truth.
Thanks for supporting me.
Tom bought a newspaper.
You better go ahead. Don't wait for me.
This river isn't very deep.
Tom is going to be gone all day.
I hope I'm not too late.
Tom is always interested.
I think I made a mistake.
Tickets are $30 in advance, or $35 on the day of the show.
They thought they were invincible.
The temperature is below zero today.
Sami's interrogation ended immediately.
Tom loves his wife.
It depends largely on the context.
I'm tired but I'll do it anyway.
You need to be better than that.
I went to the Halloween party as a vampire.
She made friends with him in Boston.
What makes you think I'm going to go to Boston with Tom?
The bridge crosses the bay.
I paid for the drinks.
They say that he was in the hospital in those days.
I want to see!
Tom doesn't get this.
I won't be pushed into this.
You have my permission.
He saved no less than ten thousand dollars.
I've returned.
I asked Ann if she were a student.
All I want you to do is talk to us.
Spanish is her mother tongue.
Compare your answers with the teacher's.
I want you to consider this.
The truce did not last long.
That house belongs to us.
Did you think I wouldn't find you?
I need to know how this happened.
It was solid red.
The fan doesn't work.
Did you see Tom hug me?
When will you be back? "It all depends on the weather."
That's not where I wanted you to go.
Tom is planning to go home soon.
Tom asked Mary to go to a movie with him.
Tom thinks that the world is getting worse all the time.
I feel so good!
She kicked him out of the house.
It was difficult to persuade him to cancel the trip.
You can't see gas; it's invisible.
I'll ask.
I missed the point of the joke.
Should I not have told him?
You are struggling greater forces!
The gods do not take kindly to heretics.
Many obstacles were put in Tom's way.
I've got nothing to say.
Tom thanked Mary.
Tom isn't as tough as he looks.
Both Magdalena and Ania are from Poland.
The result was quite shocking.
I think Tom is drunk.
I am Polish and I come from Warsaw.
Tom didn't wait for Mary.
He cried with joy.
Everything seems in order.
I went to the station to say good-bye to my friend.
Had I known about it, I would have told you.
I asked her if he liked Chinese food.
My friends scolded me for my stupid behavior.
He had little experience with international issues.
The eggplant was great.
Her family lives in this city.
Is it OK if I call you Tom?
I recognized her the moment I saw her.
Tom bought a T-shirt at the concert.
We're taking it slow.
The hill commands a fine view.
Can you supply me with everything I need?
Your answer doesn't make sense.
What time did you go to bed yesterday?
I'll be there in a second.
Tom said that he thought that he needed to help Mary.
I don't believe such things exist.
She lies to me all the time.
When was the last time you sent a letter abroad?
Tom couldn't afford to do that.
I am harvesting wheat.
I hope you can help us.
He can't accommodate himself to his circumstances.
Are you trying to kill us?
Can you help me find it?
They didn't tell me their names.
Tom isn't the only one who laughed.
She is kind to old people.

Tom didn't approve of the way Mary dressed.
She drew a circle on a piece of paper with a pencil.
Because I was in a hurry, I had to take a taxi.
He remembers Mr Black's car.
Tom reached for the coffee.
I think telling lies is wrong.
Tom kept a straight face.
I don't think I deserved that.
He escaped from prison.
Following the accident he recovered quickly.
I need to rent a car.
Are you sure that's what it was?
I'm taking my son to the zoo this afternoon.

We'll stay here for as long as we can.
The locomotive is at the end of the train.
Bend your knees and look in front of you.
I thought Tom would be doing that all day.
I'm sure Tom will tell us if he needs something.
Tom didn't do that fast enough.
I don't want them to take advantage of me.
He has a nice build.
I knew Tom was a better swimmer than I was.
No one is going to understand you.
Neither Mary nor John can swim.
Not all the students are against the plan.
My younger sister is famous.
I knew it wouldn't be hard to do that.
Sami decorated the office.
I really think we're safe here.
I was very surprised that Tom wasn't at your party.
I'll bet you that you're wrong about that.
Tom and I are soulmates.
There is an abundance of pictures in the book.
I love this video.
Call me when you get home.
I don't care about them.
The doctor insisted that the patient get plenty of rest.
We need food, clothes and a home in order to live.
What's the news?
We found a way to win.
That was a good experience.
He didn't show it to me at all.
Tom said he had a cold.
Tom shouted Mary's name as loud as he could, but she didn't hear him.
Why wasn't I informed?
You don't have to decide right now.
Before deciding to buy it, I tried on the jacket to see if it would fit.
I'll be there next week.
That's a beautiful name.
Do you believe most of what you read and see in the news?
We make sake from rice.
Why would Tom be different?
This is a strange sentence.
Beauty is a short-lived tyranny.
Tom is a soldier through and through.
You seem to be trying to get Tom to do that.
She spends a lot of time on the phone.
Do you know whether Tom is married or single?
I think I wouldn't enjoy doing that with Tom.
Hey, it's still warm.
Our son was killed in action.
This is humiliating.
Are you certain that's what you want?
I never thought I'd be happy to hear your voice.
Tom and Mary got into an argument.
It's likely that Tom won't do that.
I was hoping I would be out of the hospital before ski season started.
We'll get you out of here.
I would do the same thing.
I am saving money in order to study abroad.
You're overqualified for this job.
I will take three of each kind.
Her blood flowed over her chest.
I'm sick and tired of pretending that I'm something that I'm not.
Sami will probably never see Layla again.
I want to learn Tigrinya.
I don't think it's going to be easy.
I bought a camera the other day.
The only kidney I have is functioning better than the two I had.
Sami lost his mobility.
I hear voices.
He embezzled public money.
Ken put his shirt on inside out.
Sami is preparing to leave.
I advised him to keep the secret.
Tom opened his suitcase and took out a clean shirt.
He's not here because he's on a business trip to Osaka.
As a result of the storm, he didn't arrive.
Some say it is so; others differ.
What's that building?
Shouldn't we wait a bit longer?
I hope he doesn't die.
This is your only chance.
You need to do that today.
No matter how sneaky you are, you can never surprise yourself.
It seems so.
Tom is losing the fight.
Should we be worried?
It seems unfair to me.
There's only one torpedo left.
I've got a touch of the flu.
Maybe you'd like to help.
Tom wondered what would happen next.
Tom is a talented painter.

I was at my wit's end after having failed to contact her.
For me, it's not that big a deal.
He's very talented.
I taught Tom French for three years.

This will set a good example.
Promise me you won't get mad if I tell you.
Are you saying that you don't think I can do it?

There's no other way to look at it.
I went to a park this morning.
Tom tried to remember where he had put his passport.
Tom looked like he was enjoying himself.
The purpose of our trip is to visit a new factory.
This is the only alternative.
Tom said he'd do that for you.
I don't know who they were.
Is that so difficult?
I wish I hadn't asked Tom to teach you how to drive.
We're ignoring you.
How would I do it?
Are these bags Tom's?
It is not recommended to leave phone handsets out of the charger for long periods of time.

May I talk with you for a moment?
We queued up for the bus.
A smile spread across her face.
I've often seen him bullied.
Whether we like it or not, we have to go there.
I can't trust my textbook.

We're all infected.
The ship will set sail for Hong Kong tomorrow at 3 p.m.
Tom said that he doesn't think that Mary enjoyed doing that.
I know that eventually I'm going to have to do that.
Tom was angry at me for not coming.
Tom was a little worried about Mary.
I'm pretty sure Tom has already made up his mind.

Sami admitted pulling the trigger.
I need a huge favor.
It is imperative for you to act at once.
I wonder if Tom knows what's going to happen.
Tom's friends are always on their phones.
We're in big trouble.
We never forget our true friends.
How does Tom intend to help?

I don't want to think about the price of gasoline.
You should do what we're doing.
Tom wasn't polite.
I can't ask him now.
Tom will ask Mary to do that for John.
There was nothing to do.
Sugar is sweet, lemon is sour... and what is bitter?
Where are you folks from?
She hired a driver.
Time has come to get serious.
He cannot have completed the work by himself.

You've got no choice.
Tom reread the poem.
Tom has just now agreed to do that.

That seems reasonable enough.
Let's do that tomorrow, not today.

They're weird.
We pay a lot of bills.
We're at school together.
The mosquitoes are really bad here. I'm getting eaten alive.
Do you think I'm funny?
My job is to forgive you, which I do.
During a walk in the park she accidentally met her old friend.
I stepped on Tom's foot.
The French drink wine.
I don't want you to go back to Boston.
What time does the train get in?
I think Tom had a real good year.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom asked Mary if she was planning to go to Boston with John.
I don't worry about that.
He is a math-geek.
I'm counting on you to do that.
Are you single? "Technically yes, but I got a date this Friday."
There are no towels.
It is starting to rain.
Mary said she wouldn't be able to do that.
Do you want me to come over?
Let's assume Tom is right.
We took a family vacation to Tahiti.
Did you recognize any of those people?
Tom called Mary Monday evening.
I think we should start over.
I don't feel like playing tennis this afternoon.
I can teach you how to hunt.
I've always preferred working alone.
He was among the first to start feeling like this.
I heard that you want to learn French.
You're the only one to survive the attack.
The box is from Chile, according to the label.
I think Mary is too young to wear makeup.
Either you or I will have to do it.
I do not program their integrated circuits.
My friend likes chocolate ice cream.
Tom asked Mary to sweep the floor.
I'd like to be a veterinarian.
Tom will have to talk to Mary.
Tom worked in Boston for a long time.
My friends will be here at any moment.
What makes you think I'm lost?
Who did you come with?
Edmundo was shooting at Rima.
Have you told them this?
Tell me when to start.
The National Library is undoubtedly one of the points of interest.
Eat as much as you want.
He made me feel like such an idiot.
What exactly does it mean?
She always got up early.
Taste this and tell me what you think.
Where on earth did you meet Tom?
How long have you been in town?
I don't know if he'll come.
Can you pay off your loans in a year?
Tom doesn't like cats.
They've made improvements.
Tom is a lot younger than me.
He threw the letter into the fire.
He likes these cats.
I want to stop this rumor before it goes any further.
We've gotten a lot of compliments.
Respect the colonel.
The zoo is only a short walk from here.
Tom is a Canadian citizen.
This is totally irrelevant.
I didn't manage to see who it was.
It's raining heavily.
You can use a dreamcatcher to catch your nightmares.
We were glad we had each other.
Tom has a large family.
I'm a friend of the princess.
Anybody hurt?
Witnesses are asked to call the police.
I like honest people.
I see him as a stranger.
I'll come to you tomorrow.
I spoke in class.
Tom put on his shoes.
Where do you think Tom is going to live?
Tom was the one who organized the party.
Tom is not old enough.
We'll have a great time in Boston.
What language is spoken in your country?
Is it as bad as that?
What kinds of things do you do every day?
The language's future looks promising.
He gave a powerful testimony.
It became useless.
This really doesn't concern you.
Tom is on the third floor.
Tom said Mary didn't look like a teacher.
Why do I always have to put up with these things?
Tom is not very good at French.
Without hesitation, he told his wife the truth.
I'm not going to need that.
I did that today for the first time.
I'm Tom's wife.
The police are looking into the incident.
Tom will have to deal with that on his own.
I rarely complain about anything.
Do you have a picture of Tom?
Did you say Tom was murdered?
I found it pretty hard to adjust to my new surroundings.
I might not be able to do that tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is still drunk.
Witches fly on broomsticks.
Tom easily guessed Mary's password.
I'm not going to say anything against Tom.
Tom would've wanted it that way.
They were found dead.
I hit rock bottom.
I'm apartment hunting.
The leaves rustle in the wind.
I thought that was fantastic.
Take an aspirin.
You may find it difficult to wrap your mind around this fact.
I'm waiting for my suitcase.
Tom says we can start without him.
We'll work it out.
They fired me.
His wife gave birth to twins.
I'd rather stay here than go there.
Tom is about to begin, isn't he?
He really loved me.
Tom let out a big sigh.
She showed her album to me.
Tom is going to get hurt, isn't he?
I could do it again if I had to.
Tom speaks both French and English.
I don't believe I did that.
Tom said that he had a hard time doing that.
He finished sorting the papers.
This music is giving me a headache.
I'm pretty sure it was Tom who did that.
I was told you wanted to see me.
My father insisted on our waiting for the train.
She kissed him without shame, on the mouth.
The chicken is raw.
I can give you a long life.
Jane calls a spade a spade.
I'll keep on trying.
We shouldn't have done what Tom asked us to do.
Do you know how to make ice cream?
I'll never let you go.
Motorcycles are very cheap.
That's huge.
I refuse to give up on this.
Everyone agreed on that.
These flowers are for you, Mary. "How sweet! Thanks!"
Tom helped me do my homework.
Well, if you didn't do it, then who did?
We can't see any stars tonight.
Karl works the night shift at Walmart.
Tony could see a river and an old bridge.
I love both my daughter and my son.
Mike managed to carry the suitcase by himself.
That was no accident; someone set the house on fire.
Tom was good at that.
Tom suddenly got happy when Mary walked into the room.
If you're going to go to France, you should brush up on your French.
I'm afraid we can't help you.
Mr Johnson suddenly changed his mind and signed the contract.
It's very likely Tom will be chosen.
Tom told me why I should study French.
You'd better not do it.
I found the key I was looking for.
How many times have I told you to fold your clothes?
It is getting darker. It may rain soon.
They waited for him for hours.
Some kind of party upstairs kept me up until one last night.
Give me thirty dollars now and I'll pay you back Monday.
She left an hour ago so she should've arrived by now.
Tom said Mary is going to eat dinner with us.
Sami was in bed.
I would like to give him a present for his birthday.
How would you suggest doing that?
Are you going to invite Tom to the party?
Tom wanted to make a point.
I was having so much fun.
She was one of the most beautiful girls.
We're here for them.
Contact us to check availability.
What are you doing in Brazil?
Your mommy's native language was Esperanto, I guess.
Our progress was put in check.
Tom accepted the offer without hesitation.
They won't all be like this.
Tom didn't notice the change.
He was a former United States Marine.
Did Tom spill something again?
Tom says he doesn't know what Mary did.
We were looking for them.
Please don't say anything.
They're bringing him in for questioning now.
He has to go to England in the summer.
He often acts without thinking.
Tom reached for his gun.
I care about them.
I've heard worse.
There are many questionable points in this ledger.
Do you want me to do it again?
The prodigal son returned home.
Tom is probably in the building.
Do you know what I want?
She is a biologist.
Your assumptions are correct.
Mary still remembers Tom's bitter words.
This was your big chance, Tom, and you blew it.
All of us stared at Tom.
Please speak in a louder voice.
It is a great honour for me to help her.
Health is not valued until sickness comes.
You need an interpreter.
We became best friends immediately.
Come home early, Bill. "Yes, Mother."
Tom will succeed eventually.
Tom asked if he could use my phone.
He took care of the baby.
I got real sick.
I know that Tom is lazy.
I was talking about you.
Do you have any smaller sizes?
I'm not free yet.
Hunger is a very powerful human instinct which can compel us to extremes of behaviour.
Who'll come?
That's how we do things.
Children say such stupid things.
What if Tom did that?
I don't have time to argue with you; I'm preparing the food.
I don't have a place to live.
I was with him this afternoon.
What haven't you done?
A new idea came to me.
I'll go meet him soon.
Tom agreed to do it.
There used to be a library here.
Apart from English, he also teaches math.
Tom and Mary both like Korean food.
It is not easy to get rid of a bad habit.
Tom is reluctant to do that.
You're thirsty, aren't you?
People your age often have this problem.
They did an unimaginable job.
The setting sun is not yellow, but orange.
Tom plotted to destroy the project.
What'll you do then?
I think I know who the other guy is.
I didn't know you were expecting anyone.
She was playing with her sister at that time.
Today, I want to run on the beach.

She advised me where to stay.
Tom accompanied Mary to her parents' house.
Tom and I aren't coming.
The accident happened right before our eyes.
Sami has already converted to Islam.
Would you like to eat some pudding?
All Tom left was a note.
Don't waste your time worrying about it.
Tom is too young to do that.
What makes you so confident?
Could Tom have done that by himself?
I don't want you eating between meals.
I tried to pretend that I didn't care.
Tom lodges with me.
You have no authority to tell me what to do.
I'm the baby of the family.
I'm not very good at this. "Neither am I."
You've been warned twice.
He accused the man of stealing.
I just told them we're dating.
Are you straight or gay? "I'm straight."
He had not been a strong president.
It makes perfect sense.
What do you recommend to me?
Nobody asked them.
What's going on here?
You must eat fruits.
It's a quarter till five.
I've come to take you home.
Tom stood quietly.
I'm sure Tom can't do that.
Are you ready for tonight?
They'll be waiting.
Parrots imitate human speech.
He doesn't check his figures when he's calculating.
You made Tom unhappy.

Look at that short pretty girl.
Be careful not to hurt yourself.
We can understand French.
I'm not deaf.
I'll never be as good as Mary.
Would you like to see my tattoo?
Please give me paper for writing.
What shoes fit well?
Can you add me to the list?
You have the body of an athlete.
I got my hair cut.
I appreciate the confidence.
Tom accelerated.
Where did Tom learn to do this?
I won't tell anyone if you don't.
When I was a child, I played catch with my father.
I've met him once before.
I have eight brothers and sisters.
I hope I can be here a long time.
The banana is sweet.
Tom is emotionally blackmailing Mary.
I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come to help me.
Have you wrapped all your Christmas presents?
Please knock before entering.
Thanks for taking him fishing.
That's a fair assumption.
Tom is drinking directly from the faucet.

This makes me so mad.
You don't look too sure.
Tom was sensible.
Stand out of my sun.
Tom said Mary wasn't at school.
Do you like the poem I wrote for you?

I'm going to Australia this fall.
I have a severe pain here.
Have you ever played dominoes?
I'd like to know where he was.
He won't let anybody sit in his armchair.
I see a book.
I love you so much that I'll stay away from you.
He drives without a licence.
Why did you kiss me?
Tom was forty-five minutes late.
Who is Norman Finkelstein? "He is an American political scientist."
If this ideology is racist, colonialist, and unjust, then I think that's what it must be called. You have to call a spade a spade.

Our former home was in Sweden.
Pass me the broom and dustpan, please. I spilled some crumbs on the floor.

I suppose that's all I can do.
They exchanged ideas before reaching a decision.
Boys tend to look down on their younger sisters.
I lost myself for a moment.
So far as I am concerned, I am not against his plan.
I promise you I won't do it again.
Sorry, I didn't see the sign.
The trouble is that you are too young.
Why don't you sing a song for everybody?
Tom spoke softly to Mary in French.
Mary put the silver locket around her neck.
What a ghastly sight!
Tom told me you despised Mary.
Why is this bus stopping?
I beat you.
Tom must've been jealous.
Whose turn is it to deal the cards?
Tom will be motivated to do that.
We're soul mates.
Gunter found beer cans on the porch.
Tom was enlarging the photos.
I'm afraid I've eaten too much.
I felt so out of place.
I missed a lot of work through illness, so I've a lot of catching up to do.
I'll get up at sunrise.
We saw them on TV.
They sent for a doctor at once.
There were more than 100 students there.
Is there some reason you don't want us to come?
Tom was so goofy.
I don't know if that will be enough money for me.
Tidy up a bit and we'll go to the movies.
My advice is to tell Tom how you feel.
That's what everyone says.
My friend is seventeen.
Tom is too nosey.
I was brokenhearted.
Tendons and ligaments are more fragile than you might think.
He has made a promise to come again.
Tom convinced Mary to lend him some money.
Tell Tom the air conditioner needs to be repaired.
Tom's health has been deteriorating for some time.
All my cakes are delicious!
Tom realized that Mary had been lying to him.
I persuaded Tom to go to Boston.
It was very crowded in the room.
Felix went silent for a few seconds.
I will arrive on 23 May.
Tom and Mary are both teachers, aren't they?
I am no better than a beggar.
I don't know what can be done about it.
I have an idea.
She kept on asking me questions the whole time.
Sami spent more time with Layla.
She wrote the word.
Are we being chased?
I was once in Paris, but that was a long time ago.
Don't you want to be famous?
Why's Tom always here?
Are you honestly telling me you never want to see Tom again?
The couple parted, never to meet again.
Tom wanted Mary dead.
My hand had to be amputated.
Tom is at school now, isn't he?
You're really angry, aren't you?
I demand that this plan be approved and enforced as soon as possible.
The truth is that he was not fit for the job.
She picked the most expensive dress.
Tom is definitely up to something!
Tom left within a few months.
All of my friends like soccer.
Only Tom did that.
I blush for your mistake.
Please send this document before the end of the month.
Tom went home for the weekend.
No matter how drunk you were, Goethe was a poet!
Above the table is a lamp.
Nobody's seen Tom.
I hope Tom and Mary don't do that.
How much fire insurance do you think I need?
Did Tom not know how to do that?
Tom never seems to cry.
You eat too much.
He is now looking for a bigger house to live in.
You said you liked it.
Show me your papers!
You saw that movie, right?
He's only a boy, but he is very thoughtful.
Tom has been in prison for half his life.
I think that Tom is sick.
I've lost the feeling in my legs.
Since when have you been learning Latin?
Sami was murdered by Layla.
Do we have to go?
This car uses a futuristic engine.
You can't live without water.
I'm trying to figure out why Tom left.
Tom actually figured it out by himself.
Did the thought ever cross your mind?
That budget isn't yet final.
Tom convinced Mary to make him a sandwich.
Everybody fears that prison.
Tom didn't know how worried I was.
It would be really sad if that happened.
That comes to the same thing.
That was all I could afford.
The North African human smugglers use the Italian navy as a travel agency.
He asked us what we wanted.
There is a blank space in front of the first letter of this sentence that should be removed.
We admire your loyalty.
Ask him whether they still live in Tokyo.
We mustn't tell anyone.
Who was here first?
We tried to warn her.
Sami was too shy to say anything.
You aren't going to give up, are you?
Tell Tom not to tell Mary.
He took a taxi to the station.
There was more to come.
I think we all know the answer.
Things are never black and white.
Nothing is planned.
He responded very quickly to my letter.
What have you done with him?
You can probably learn how to do that in about three hours.
Tom took everything to his office.
Tom said he'd pick me up at six.
We walked home.
Tom isn't skinny.
It's a red herring.
Tom wouldn't steal from you.
We didn't expect all this attention.
If you go anywhere, you had better tell your mother first.
Is it cold outside?
No one can transcend their own individuality.
We have different color eyes.
I think you worry too much, Tom.
I hope nobody saw you coming in here.
My mom has psychic powers.
There's nothing we need to do.
I was very, very lucky.
I don't care what people say.
I'm as disappointed as you are.
He's at the hotel now.
I don't want Tom telling Mary she needs to be here all day.
I wonder how Tom manages to stay so young while the rest of us are aging.
There's little cause for optimism.
My cat got stuck up a tree.
What are you guys drinking?
They moved to New York, but adapted easily to their new surroundings.
Can I ask you one last thing?
General John Pope made a terrible mistake.
Sami wanted to take his shahada in the mosque.
Tom has been writing a book.
The number 2015 is represented as 11111011111 in binary.
Have you ever had a detached retina?
We haven't decided what to do yet.
Tom wasn't feeling well.
I trusted them.
The gloomy house was like a ghost.
I smell smoke in the elevator.
I think I'll do that today.
I thought it was pretty good.
There's a chance we'll be late.
I need to go home a little early today.
He didn't pay attention to what she said.
Good students study hard.
I thought this present might be from you.
Have you ever cleaned your kitchen?
Tom certainly acted drunk.
I don't want to die tomorrow.
Tom is several years older than Mary.
Don't be so sentimental.
The library is on the right.
I have enough time.
You're incredible.
I appreciate your situation.
I didn't do that as much last week as I usually do.
There was a controversy about the location of the new school.
Tom didn't believe what Mary said.
This lock is beautiful.
I'm sorry for the mess.
Now be sensible.
Writing with chalk is trivial.
The participants accused him of carelessness.
I'm a bookworm.
I'm going to retire the next year.
I think that Tom has made a good decision.
Tom confessed.
Tom delivers newspapers.
Tom said he was going to call the police.
He snuck out and had a few beers with his friends.
Sami came to the bar to eat breakfast.
I have my career to think of.
In many parts of the world, there isn't enough food to meet everyone's needs.
Tom said he told you.
I hate being photographed.
There's something inside this box.
Are you sure it's safe to move this dynamite?
Do you know anyone who can translate this French document for me?
Tom went home alone.
Tom hasn't really been doing anything.
I am not worthy of this.
Tom thinks Mary won't kiss John.
Tom reached for a towel.
You should not have lent the money to such a person.
I visited my father's hometown last summer.
I'd like to know where Tom hid his key.
We're out of danger.
I'm happy for both of you.
A female friend of mine loves to go to gay bars with me.
I have a test tomorrow.
Curacao uses a phonetic writing system.
I'm sorry for the trouble.
Do you really think that's the case?
No one asked how Tom was doing.
And the Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? And she answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat.
The number of students who use their holidays to travel abroad is increasing.
Does it snow a lot in the winter?
Tom pretended to not hear a thing.
Somebody call a doctor.
I'll stand by you through thick and thin.
Sami's cigarettes smelt like marijuana.
Why did you bring them?
Tom isn't focused.
You're watching Tatoeba TV.
I don't want him to get hurt.
They need volunteers.
Tom is really sharp, isn't he?
Layla worked on many criminal cases.
Tom told Mary that John would do that.
Are you still at work?
After you leave, I'll be lonely.
Are you sure this time?
Pick up your trash.
Aren't you the one who took my knife?
Tom plays tennis well, but he doesn't play very often.
They want it.
Tom will come back. I'm sure he will.
Would you please leave?
I won't sleep tonight.
I cannot speak and listen as well as I write.
I heard about Tom and Mary.
We need to stop this experiment.
I wish I'd known how to speak French.
We don't have to do this now.
These are the results we've been waiting for.
Tom and Mary were present.
We found Tom's umbrella.
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 for supposedly giving nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union.
He likes me.
I want you to stay here and take care of Tom.
Both buildings burned down.
I didn't think I'd see Tom again.
All attempts to photograph a donkey smoking a cigar failed.
He is looking for a job.
My grandma is a very independent person.
Let's keep this a secret, OK?
I believe in my husband.
I did that here.
Tom was going to help you do that.
Tom and Mary are in the cafeteria.
I'd like to hear that from him.
I think Tom is greedy.
We had complaints about one of the volunteers from Brussels.
Tom is going to be mad at us.
It's always dark there.
I have no love for Tom.
I warned Tom not to pitch his tent so near the river.
I don't think that he's honest.
The pupils began to read all together.
She was sad for the first time in months.
I won't tell anybody that you were here.
I might stay in Boston for over a month.
Tom bent down and pretended to be tying one of his shoes.
Tom says I take myself too seriously.
Sami shot Layla then disappeared.
Ask Tom what he's doing tonight.
How did the accident happen?
You should eat more spinach. It's good for you.
Many people pray before eating.
I don't know who to blame.
I don't need more advice.
I told you I didn't want to go.
Tom is very good at playing the piano.
I'll never forgive myself if anything's happened to Tom.
She was the last to arrive.
I think this tie will go great with that shirt.
Please visit there today.
My sock has a hole in it.
Tom seemed reassured.
I ordered some coffee from room service.
He drives a car, doesn't he?
Tom said he felt repulsed.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom is in, isn't he?
I didn't rescue anybody.
Tom promoted his pawn into a queen.
Is it cheaper to call after 9:00?
Why couldn't Tom be the one to do that?
I stated the obvious.
You might not like what you see.
He's moved away.
The recent events have affected him deeply.
She asked me about my mother.
Did you tell them about it?
Tom and Mary are both still teenagers, aren't they?
They were yelling for help.
Tom can't stop Mary from doing that.
Sami crossed the line.
I kept packing.
She's reading a novel.
You're not cooperating.
Tom is the one who told me your phone number.
Hey, can I help?
Do you like my friend?
He allowed his books to fall on the floor.
His opinions carry weight.
Don't you trust anybody?
Did the two of you meet in Boston?
We began to pound the enemy positions with cannon fire.
May I have something hot to drink?
I'm feeling like a kid with a new toy. Tatoeba is back!
I would like a cup of coffee, please.
Sami knows everyone by sight.
I know someone you work with.
That seems familiar to me.
Tom should do it soon.
We were denied transportation.
What is your name?
Don't mess with me again, or you'll pick up your teeth with broken fingers.
Is it Friday?
I wanted Tom to kiss me.
What can I do to reduce the air pollution in this city?
Why wouldn't you listen to his advice?
He can run fast.
I have never seen such a beautiful girl.
It fell short of my expectation.
Tom is a very honest guy.
Tom eats anything.
Can I give you a lift?
I got a letter from her today.
I wouldn't like to be in Tom's shoes.
Tom hates his stepfather.
You could've stayed at my place.
I'll let you know tomorrow.
You won't regret hiring him.
The merchant seems to be an honest person.
Nothing could've prepared Tom for what was about to happen.
Sami's trial isn't over.
The only way to escape air pollution is to live in the middle of nowhere.
It helped me a lot!
Tom is a little angry at Mary.
Why aren't you coming home?
Sami left a latex glove at the crime scene.
I told you you'd like it.
That's just beautiful.
I didn't know about that.
Tom is a little embarrassed.
Why does she call me cute? Cute is such a dumb word. I'm not a rabbit.
The results of the experiment were mixed. Some participants reacted positively, but others offered severe criticism.
Tom can speak French almost as well as me.
We're unlikely to do that.
Where are you? "I'm here!"
Tom and Mary are taking a big risk.
Angola's official language is Portuguese.
I wasn't very motivated.
Here stood a green field; now it is a supermarket.
It took us a long time to find Tom.
Just give me one more chance to do that.
I don't eat meat or eggs.
These ice cubes will melt soon.
It was very careless of me.
Both far-left and far-right German political parties are at their strongest in the former East German states.
I've never been burnt.
Tom wasn't supposed to get paid for doing that.
I had a great time here.
Tom was acting like a child.
It's like a horse race.
Forget about Tom.
Tom is going to come this week, too.
I made a deal.
Did anyone see him in Germany?
Tom cooked spaghetti for dinner.
His father won't come, he is very busy.
Tom could hardly wait to see Mary.
We all shall die sooner or later.
How tall are they?
Tom may be able to come tomorrow.
Tom had three dogs.
We need a distraction.
I'm a very lucky man.
That's Tom's office.
I want to lie down for a few minutes.
I wish I had brought a map.
Tom takes his dog for a walk every morning.
She happened to know his address.
Stop staring.
At least I'm still alive.
The man looked at Tom, then vanished through the stage door out into the dark London street.
Tom had to work hard all day.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.
Fadil called Layla's cell.
Tom can understand why Mary is feeling depressed.
I'd never make you do that.
Why don't you talk it over with Tom?
I knew that Tom wouldn't hurt me.
I saw Tom talking with Mary.
I wish for your success.
That's not what it means.
Get me a lawyer.
Are we ready to eat?
Only a halfwit would say something like that.
Please come by 2:30.
Tom refused to believe that he was wrong.
I must finish it before I go out.
We need to work as a team.
A language is a key to the heart of millions.
She said that she had been happy.
Can you see anything in there?
You managed it after all.
If you do that, you're going to subject yourself to ridicule.
Hi everyone, I'm Tom.
Tobias's apartment was huge.
Dan tried to contact Linda's family.
It's unusually warm today.
How many floors does that building have?
Do Tom and Mary have many friends?
We have a houseful of guests.
I need permission from your parents or guardian.
I will try to avoid tunnels as much as possible.
Tom is important.
We need a new plan.
Tom seemed awfully busy.
Tom heard a dog barking.
Have you ever donated blood?
Kisses, hugs, affections... it was all fake.
Why did they turn down your proposal?
Tom's trial started on Monday.
Tom was sitting at home in his pajamas watching TV and eating pizza.
Tom rested his chin on his hands.
He hid it behind the door.
Tom didn't understand Mary at all.
Tom looks a little upset.
You're in a restricted area.
You can't stay mad at me forever.
I ran out of gas.
Your dog is here.
He would often go to the hill.
The captain ordered his men to fire.
That lecture was a waste of time.
I need to talk to Tom tonight about what's going to happen tomorrow.
We know you have it.
Tom said that he was very cold.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy bread.
There are many tourists in town.
Don't make me guess.
He licked his fingers.
I was kidding.
Get me a chair, please.
I have to get Tom a present.
My name is unimportant.
You'd better hurry up.
And what did you see?
Tom will likely be tired.
That decision is up to Tom.
The energy expended in a fight should be saved.
Tom is better than we are.
She tried not to cry.
Tom fell and injured his knee.
Do you ever have involuntary urination?
Tom ate my lunch.
She drives everybody up the wall.
I will wait for my sister here.
It was yesterday morning that I saw Mr. Carter.
He's still alive.
Tom and I made a bargain.
Tom is Mary's stepson.
Tom knows what Mary said.
Tom is pretty devastated.
I don't want that happening.
Tom is still doing that, I think.
Did I tell you I got my own office?
One thing that won't change is my salary.
Where're the shoes?
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
No one cares about us.
Our language is being invaded by foreign words.
I'll have two hot dogs with mustard and ketchup.
Come tomorrow to see me.
It's past noon. Let's eat.
They have taken her away.
I'm going to go talk to her.
Tom says he isn't afraid to do that.
What are the rooms like?
It was just a dumb mistake.
Have you ever studied archeology?
He has come from Boston.
Jim jumped for joy when the news came.
She felt so humiliated that she couldn't say anything.
Happy birthday, Aiba!
We've got three whole hours.
They're idiots.
It looks like they've stopped following us.
Let's go ahead and eat.
It's better not to say anything about her to him.
Give me a bottle of water.
Are you going to fire me?
What happened was out of my control.
I felt excited.
Can I wait here?
Tom died in a car crash.
Is that the truth, Tom?
Tom wanted to know what Mary did last weekend.
I wonder why Tom told me I shouldn't do that.
Both Tom and Mary are teachers.
I thought it would be romantic.
Something caught Tom's attention.
He can't maintain a conversation.
Tom abused my trust.
First of all, I want you to tell me how did you get there.
Do you want half of this cake?
I'll bring him.
I have to go back to Boston.
We plan to have a welcoming party for Mr. Clark who came to Japan the other day.
The thieves knew what they were doing.
This medication could knock out a horse.
I'm not good at this.
I hope you'll agree.
I have waited for you for a long time!
I need some more people.
I would love to see it.
We talked about it all night.
Don't worry, I can do this.
This data supports the hypothesis.
Tom will get a chance to help.
I was very encouraged.
I'm insane.
Please don't tell this to your parents.
Frequently air out the spaces you are in.
You can't take pictures here.
A true friendship is more valuable than money.
There are many shrines in Kyoto.
You won't be able to help them.
We'll have to wait and see what happens.
You miss them, don't you?
Would you mind if I asked you a question?
Fadil showed his true colors. He was a coward.
He is very friendly to us.
You don't have to explain yourself to me.
He demanded payment of the debt.
I'm tired of everything.
Sami is coming back.
The suspect was innocent of the crime.
I assumed that you were busy.
That is an archaic expression.
You're still not convinced we're telling the truth, are you?
Mary asked Tom could he keep a secret.
Did Tom tell you any interesting stories?
Tom certainly looks better than he did last week.
He is an expert in economics.
Every now and then I like to have hot and spicy food.
That hat cost fifty dollars.
How is Tom now?
I was really cute when I was a kid.
I am pregnant.
He waited until she came.
The main valve is turned off.
I've seen Tom do some amazing things.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Tom, what's the matter?
It looks just perfect.
I think Tom would like you to do that for Mary.
I tend to talk too much.
Love is never wrong.
I want to climb the mountain.
Tom has never won anything in his whole life.
The manager put up a notice about the extra holiday.
Did you take back the books?
Tom said he'd never heard of me.
You should try not to scratch your mosquito bites.
I didn't have a bicycle when I was growing up.
He smiled.
Do not enter the pool.
He was dismissed by the boss of the factory.
Marie knows the history of the United States very well.
We need a new secretary.
There are many lakes in the area where you live.
I had gone there.
You can't interfere.
My symptoms increase with age.
There was no sign of Fadil but his car was there.
Sami missed Layla terribly.
We call him Mike.
Tom told me that he couldn't breathe.
Do you like Indian food?
I suggested that to him.
Tom slept on the sofa.
The value of his discovery was not realized until after his death.
Justify your attitude, come on, justify being there when it all happened.
This horse belongs to us.
Laura may have been sick.
Our car ran out of gas after ten minutes.
Tom speaks perfect French.
Is there any mail for me this morning?
I don't remember you asking me to dance.
He promised to sell.
Six million Britons have never used the Internet.
I think Tom must be hungry.
Do you like English?
Gabriel was driving a car.
We no longer need you.
Has Tom finished his homework yet?
Tom is their only child.
You have to study more.
Child, my name is Jesus and I'm your father.
Sami didn't know that school.
That was my lunch.
I called Tom's parents.
The door squeaked.
Tom has been talking about you all day.
Alice learned how to write in Korean.
The police considered the crime to be serious.
Just go talk to him.
Read this story!
Let's play a game of baseball.
We slept in a very small tent.
I don't think Tom is going to be too much help.
I assume you'll be explaining why all this is necessary.
I'm about the same age as you are.
There was no need for us to do that.
Tom was too young to do that.
Tom spilled his drink, so I bought him another one.
He struggled to climb to the top.
Do you have my money?
This building has three floors.
Tom said he didn't think Mary wanted to do that anymore.
I am his friend and will remain so.
He won't beat me.
I think he will object to our plan.
I see him in the library now and then.
Did you advise the suspect of his rights?
Sami set his alarm to wake up for the dawn prayer.
I need to see Tom at once.
Tom has a bad headache.
He's so big!
Tom spends a lot of time in the garden.
I need a place to sit.
I don't know what Tom thought.
My nose itches.
Tom said that Mary was frightened.
This is completely bogus.
You should be brief.
I'm going to get some air.
If you take this medicine, you will feel better.
I wish I could speak French the way Tom does.
Rumor flies.
Listen to us!
How restful it is to sleep under the shadow of a willow in an Anatolian village in summertime.
I know how you guys work.
Musa is an interesting guy.
I'm sending you a big file.
I want her to win.
Tom became very irate.
This is grossly unfair.
Where's the nearest post office?
Tom should be able to get it done by Monday.
It isn't too late for you.
They shake hands instead of bowing.
It's a bad time.
Mary is a lovely woman.
Tom said that he and Mary are planning to go to Boston next summer.
I've written three letters.
Tom does everything on his own.
The situation was hopeless.
You did that in Boston last summer, didn't you?
Did you really call in sick?
When would you like to do that?
Tom wondered why Mary wanted to study French.
I'm afraid that place is a little too expensive.
No matter what I eat, I never seem to gain weight.
Mary plowed the field.
I don't think I'm unbeatable.
Let's wait until 2:30 to do that.
Tom was trying to get the door open.
Tom has been trying to teach me how to cook.
I'm all tuckered out.
Tom knew that he should study French every day if he really wanted to learn it.
Who's taller, you or Tom?
She is really pissed off at me.
Mary knitted a sweater for Tom.
According to her, he will not go.
My apartment is small.
Have you ever done that before?
Where can I purchase index funds?
Don't tell me you're tired.
Fadil said that to me before.
We seldom kiss each other anymore.
He just needs help.
Going for a walk with you would make me happy.
People used to think that the tomato was poisonous.
I don't think that's quite true.
Let's be friends, OK?
I think it's unlikely to happen.
Tom should be with you in just a minute.
I think you should stop complaining so much.
Business is so slow these days.
In order to beat them, we practice very hard.
Tom is starting to look a lot like his father.
Tom is a jerk.
Does anybody have any good news?
I prefer to be hanged rather than being shot.
That was devastating to Tom.
I'll certainly do this.
Law is born from despair of human nature.
We left early.
I'm grieving.
I did some busking during the summer.
My office is near Starbucks.
The teenager is showing off his new car.
Tell me what you need right now.
Even a minor injury can kill you.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be absent.
It comes with soup or salad.
I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from henceforth a flood to waste the earth.
I just wish I had my camera.
I can do the job right!
Tom bought a medieval shirt on Etsy.
Charity begins at home.
I still need you to help me do that.
When do we begin?
Don't let anyone pass.
It seems my field of vision is not as wide as it used to be.
Tom and I were alone in the room.
Where are we eating?
What did she buy at that store?
I'll study harder from now on.
What else did you tell Tom?
The moon is very bright tonight.
Would you please speak a little bit more slowly?
You didn't have to hide from me.
Tom isn't that dumb.
Aren't you happy about this?
Tom told me he didn't see Mary.
Contact Tom for details.
Don't you think we have pretty good alibis?
Tom told me that he thought Mary knew French.
Turn the radio up a little.
What kind of things do you do when you and Tom hang out together?
Tom's mother told him to quit jumping on his bed.
We're going to go beyond that.
I just gave blood.
I wasn't wearing a hat.
Tom slammed on his brakes.
You shouldn't judge a person by his appearance.
I'd never buy anything from Tom.
Please wake up.
If you promise something, keep your word.
Things aren't as bad as they seem.
Come and sit with us.
Don't talk to me anymore.
It would cost twice as much as that.
I don't really like the way Mr. Jackson teaches.
You should tell Tom not to do that.
I'll see you whenever it suits you.
Have you ever tried shaving your head?
Tom can talk.
Tom ran for reelection, but he lost.
That story can't be true.
All stolen cars end up here.
Let's do that now.
This is such a surprise.
I poured my heart and soul into this.
You can't outrun that bear.
Have you already washed the dishes?
This is blackberry.
Tom is a fierce competitor.
We all want to know why.

Tom said Mary is probably still thirsty.
I should be there by 2:30.
Tom went to his car to get something.
How late is the bank open?
Computer parts are very expensive in Japan.
They've never been heard of since.
Yanni never brushes his teeth. "Disgusting."
We've been there before.
Tom is literate.
Tom has no trouble speaking French.
A photograph can't explain the reasons.
I know how to fix that.
You're not old enough to drive.
The First World War took place between 1914 and 1918.
You don't have time.
Are you going to sit with her?
Tom passed the examination.
A cat wearing gloves won't catch any mice.
Can I have a word, please?
It smells wonderful.
That's completely out of the question.
Tom offered Mary a pretty good job.
You're really gifted.
Tom said that he was glad that he didn't do that.
I haven't used this much.
Everybody was jealous of my success.
I put it on your desk.
Tom's pushy.
I'm not feeling very well.
Tom said there's nothing else we can do.
Have you checked your calculations?
If you have a medical certificate, bring it.
Hey. How's it going?
That was very easy.
I'm sure Tom will like this wine.
One thousand dollars will cover all the expenses for the party.
Tom doesn't know if Mary likes pumpkin pie or not.
Tom always calls on Monday.
Tom needed a bath.
Tom is afraid to ask for help.
Do you think it's possible?
What kind of candy do you like?
I teach French at a nearby junior high school.
How do we know that?
I want a room for tonight.
I don't think Tom is particularly handsome.
What's your favorite upbeat song?
Forgive me for breaking my promise.
Tom was the only one who knew where Mary went.
He couldn't believe her story.
How can I think about anything else at a time like this?
She stared at the ceiling.
May I draw the curtains?
How much bread did you eat?
We are arguing with the neighbors.
Why did you choose such a subject?
Lukas heard a buzzing sound.
Not you, too, Tom.
I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if we stayed here.
I've done business with Tom before.
Tom looked at Mary and then winked at her.
Yesterday evening I had a terrible nightmare.
Do you know what day it is today? "It's our wedding anniversary!"
I wrote down every phrase in his speech that he stressed.
Where's my cake? "Sorry. I ate it all."
She has no reason to be angry.
How many bats are there in this cave?
He finished the race.
Thank you for the great meal.
I took the train to school this morning.
Let Tom relax.
I wish to speak with you in private. Call me.
She is crying.
Where did you want to take her?
His injuries are all external.
Is my French really so bad?
Please don't make me go.
The hurricane continued to rage.
I talked to her for an hour.
Tom tried to ask Mary a question, but she ignored him.
Tom was really a wonderful man.
Tom was unaware of what was happening.
Lincoln's plan was good.
I forgot all about you.
Where can I buy anchovies?
I wish to pretend to be an actor.
I'd like to have ketchup on the side.
Mary is a writer. She's really good.
Tom is a terrific all-around athlete.
I just finished reading that book.
I didn't do any of the things you said I did.
It's a dead give-away.
I know about that.
Who sings that song?
You need the rest.
Tom hid under his bed.
You can go now, sir.
I want some more.
Tom will like this.
She removed the papers from the desk.
Why are you looking at me that way?
I won't be your friend as long as you treat me like that.
Everything is better without you.
You're not kidding!
The child knows how to swim, so she won't drown in the water.
I'm sure Tom understands what needs to be done.
I don't like milk.
I just banged my head on something.
I couldn't let them go.
I have to admit that you're right.
I don't know anyone like that.
It took me three hours to get here.
I'd rather walk than wait for the next bus.
I can't describe my sadness.
Tom was silly.
Please let me know the results by telegram.
Don't confuse Austria with Australia.
The water is not drinkable.
It's about time for us to have another party.
When I see this photo, I think of my family.
When did you start having trouble with Tom?
Please give us room.
Where did you drop them?
Who are my new neighbors?
Tom's lack of compassion surprised Mary.
He was named Tom after his father.
I wouldn't say it this way.
It'll be a start.
His webpage is in Esperanto.
They had seven children.
Tom bought Mary lots of jewelry.
I'm starting to enjoy it.
I thought I'd surprise him.
I eat a banana roll.
This is a highly recommended restaurant.
Step out of the car, please.
Tom said he didn't know Mary's phone number.
Do you think Tom enjoyed the party?
Which kid is your favorite?
I called at his office yesterday.
Tom hoped the train would be on time.
I worked as hard as I could so I didn't fail.
Tell me you remember, Tom.
Thank you for your visit.
She said that it was important.
She is aware of her beauty.
Okay, do what you want.
She gave me a necktie which was completely to my liking.
If you knew, you would tell me, wouldn't you?
I told her what you did.
Some people think of reading as a waste of time.
Tom started to say something, but didn't.
I met an old friend a short time ago.
Tom doesn't really like Mary, even though he says he does.
Tom's nowhere to be found.
Everybody knows that Tom was in Boston.
Tom apparently didn't do what we asked him to do.
I don't think anyone would really do that.
I need a knife.
The referee stopped the fight.
There is a killer among us.
I forgot my glasses.
He is reading it.
The baby was sound asleep.
This is completely useless.
We don't go to Boston anymore.
He just missed the bus.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
Shall we drink to that?
A young man waited in line to see him.
I'm going to defeat you.
What's your favorite memory from childhood?
Jack is very severe with his children.
Who is watching the movie?
Tom thought Mary could beat John.
We have to obey orders.

My mistake.
This is the house where I live.
The strong earthquake in Hokkaido caused extensive damage.
I know a great deal about Tom.
They relaxed around the campfire.
That was a close shave.
Tom called the cops.
Tom hasn't ever taught French.
Even children can understand this book.
We have more important things we need to discuss.
I hate the color of these walls.
I'd like to see you hanged.
Open all the windows.
Did you grow up near a beach?
Tom said Mary is probably still here.
I wasn't expecting it from you!
Tom wanted to hug Mary, but he knew that he shouldn't.
Kalman refused to go back there.
Can you imagine working here?
What's there to eat?
Tom is planning to go to Boston next week, isn't he?
She showed me around the campus.
He has a bad reputation with his students.
The other day her mother passed away in the hospital.
Did Tom have a gun?
Just because he likes painting doesn't mean he's good at painting.
She is not afraid of anything.
I will do my best.
What place on Earth could be better than the place your people came from?
I'm not sure, but perhaps Tom is already dead.
Tom refused to show me how to do that.
I think you don't understand what's going on.
I could probably do that by myself.
I didn't earn this.
Who's going to foot the bill?
Tom is as talkative as his father.
How many Christmas cards did you receive last year?
Is Tom still a teacher?
To keep you is no benefit. To destroy you is no loss.
Wait for me. I'll be back.
Tom thought Mary was probably about thirty.
That accident is a very good example of what happens when you're not careful.
The window was open.
Above all, don't tell Tom.
The pulse ox sensor couldn't get a good O2 sat reading because Tom's hands were so cold.
Where were you yesterday at 2:30?
I don't know whether Tom will eat with us or not.
Tom said he isn't going to buy anything today.
We feel this is appropriate.
The room was deserted.
I didn't even hear Tom.
If that happens, give me a call.
We were cut off while talking on the telephone.
Tom loves talking about politics.
I changed plans. Moving would be too expensive right now.
If this is the information age, what are we so well-informed about?
It's clearly made you angry.
Can you teach me English?
I didn't see much of anybody.
You don't know what it was like.
I'm glad you liked it.
You had better do as the doctor advised you.
She gave away all her dresses.
They love listening to classical music.
You're not supposed to know that.
Tom asked Mary to tell him why she was leaving him.
You said you could speak French.
I need it to be my decision.
Tom and I talked about the war.
Does he have a stomach ache?
Interest rates and inflation were high.
Are you feeling all right?
I didn't know how to begin.
Tom drew a picture of his house.
I barely know Tom.
They had no chance.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius.
Tom had plenty of money.
You should not have lent the money to such a person.
They needed more.
They are made in a variety of sizes.
Take care not to break the glasses.
She did not keep her word.
I regret saying what I said.
I get your drift.
Tom owed a lot to Mary.
I think Tom knows why I'm here.
Tom went to the bakery to buy a cake.
We'll make up for the loss.
How can we join the team?
I still don't like doing that.
Tom's position on this matter is well known.
We must not allow these problems to affect the project.
I'm here on an unrelated matter.
Why did Tom return to Australia?
Don't cry over spilt milk.
There's no doubt that he likes taking walks.
Tom hinted that we should pay for the room.
Why don't you want me to help you?

I hope Tom is awake.
Seen from space, the earth is very beautiful.

Layla can help you.
The show's Wednesday.
Are you a teacher or a student?
Don't let him whistle.
He's always worrying about his daughter.
I don't know who Tom plans on going to the zoo with.
The special effects are excellent.
The cat was lying stretched out at full length in the sunlight streaming through the window.
Tom told me he doesn't like Mary.
Tom seems to be motivated.
I cared about him.
She's smarter than you think.
That made me uncomfortable.
The situation sounds volatile.
Not everyone is as considerate as you.
Tom doesn't know what it means.
Would doing that be possible?
Judith's German accent is beautiful.
Tom majored in engineering in college.
She was getting impatient.
I'll call him for you.
I'll rephrase the question.
Your English is impeccable.
I've been calling all day.
See what's going on.

Would you like to do that instead?
The chauffeur opened the door.
Mary has been struck by lightning three times.
How do giraffes mate?
They treated me well.
Tom should have told Mary the truth.
We're well ahead of schedule.
When will we leave?
At that moment, I felt in complete harmony with the world.
I like sitting by the window.
Are you capable of doing that?
I told her not to be late.
I, too, have been to Boston.
Can you think of anyone who doesn't like Tom?
I graduated two years ago.

Tom is a lot better at doing that than me.
Tom is very important.
Tom and Mary got to know each other.
Tom knows this isn't going to go well.
Will you go shopping with me?
Wake me if you need me.
Layla parked at the lake.
I knew Tom was a barber.
I'm very impressed with your quality control.
Don't bug me.
Tom doesn't seem to be as brave as Mary seems to be.
Riches only will not satisfy me.
Nobody dared say a thing.
I hope to do that soon.
A baby rabbit had been caught in a trap.
I want you to be nice to me.

That was harder to do than Tom said it would be.
Wake them up.
You're partly right.
That was strange.
This is a car.
I wanted to swim every day.
I didn't mean to snap at you.
The answer to this question is easy.
Tom is probably going to be pretty nervous.

I didn't like rock music at first, but it soon grew on me.
Tom asked Mary to turn off the light.
I know that Tom is outraged.
The price is three hundred dollars.
That was just a stupid prank.
Perhaps I can help you.

That's over.
You are interrupting the lesson.
Would you rather wait outside?

They finally reached the top of the mountain.
Tom doesn't need comforting.
What's on your mind?
Where were they?
You're splitting hairs.
I can't imagine why Tom would do something like that.
The city was destroyed during the war.
If you get sleepy, let me know.
Why are you here, Jamal?
His interests clash with mine.
The engine will stop when you push the button.
Get her something to eat.
The car turned abruptly.
My conscience is clear.

I think Tom will never do that again.
It's unique and irreplaceable.

I think we don't need to do that.

Do you think I'm good-looking?

This power station alone provides several cities with electricity.
Tom worked for us for three years.
Are you going to rat me out?

He's doing better.
Isn't that a deal worth making?
After the bird had sung, it flew away.
Tom didn't want to be a stuntman.
I haven't told anybody yet what I found.
Tom is nothing like what you say he is.
She was wounded by a shot in the leg.
Nothing is decided yet.
This carpet does not match the curtain.
This conversation is logical.
Why can't you just call him?
Tom was killed by Mary.
She asked me if I knew how to sew.
Is there anything you want?

He told me everything.
I have to do something, guys.
You cannot be too good to your parents.
She will give a party next week.

He is without doubt one of the most successful businessmen in Japan.
What has he done?

Tom told Mary that he was in love with Alice.
My cat is sick.
I think it's no big deal.
I'm the one who showed Tom how to do that.
There's nothing else for us here.
I'm not sure I feel the same way.
I don't want to give you my money.
I haven't seen these pictures in years.
I forgot I owed you money.
This is the first time I've ever opened this door.
Tom seemed to know what Mary needed.
Nobody was allowed to go out of the room.
He parked his car in front of the building.
I am not used to being spoken to in that rude way.
Otsvoyen decided to attract the guy's attention at any price.
How long will it stop there?
This is the supermarket where we usually do most of our shopping.
Tom was very assertive.
We skied down to Chamonix.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go, too.
People just need time to adjust to the new environment.
Let them buy that for you.

I have an appointment to visit a guru in India.
I pressed the button to turn the radio on.
Mary said Tom was her son.
Someone has stolen all my money.
This is the cheapest shop in town.

It's unacceptable.
I see something.
No passengers are allowed on the bridge.
Tom plays the trombone very well.
Where did Tom hide my notebook?
I'll write to you.
I have an extra ticket.
He caught her attention.
There's just absolutely nothing happening.
Are you sure you want to quit?
How many children do you have? "I have two sons and one daughter."
I can't believe you're grounded.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
Just sit there.
I tipped the cabbie ten bucks for getting me to the airport on time.
So, what can I do for you?
Tom is never around.
Where should we eat?
Everyone knows that Tom has a thing for you.
Will she come?
I knew something bad would probably happen.
I'll visit my uncle in Boston next month.
I know you're in pain.
We're together in this.

Tom said that he knew that I was coming.
Sami started to notice that.
What should we say to Tom now?
Tom bet me Mary would be late.
Mary asked me if I loved her.
He is a good cook.
What time did you leave your house this morning?
I must exact my revenge!
How did you make this?
Why don't we just go?
There's been an interesting development.
Sami had problems with Layla in the past.
Why is the table dirty?
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
I asked Tom if he wanted to go and he said no.
We've got all night.
Don't you know what this means?
Tom came outside.
Everything was new to me.
Tom hasn't been here long.
Tom started racing at the age of thirteen.
You won, fair and square.
Have you visited Tokyo Tower?
That cost a lot of money.
She smiled widely at me.

I think that this is Tom's.
I would like to learn all the European languages.
Tom's strong interest in Mary provoked my jealousy. But I managed to conceal it.
Do you still want us to help Tom?

It seemed to work.
How much will it all cost?

I think you'll be able to do it.
Can I talk to you for a sec?
I think Tom must be pretty sleepy by now.
Tom and I are fine.
I know that Tom is afraid of everybody.
I knew exactly what to look for.
In reality, the explanation is a bit more complicated than this, but you get the gist.

He is going to leave tomorrow afternoon.
Tom wasn't supposed to do that.
We are building a bridge.
Can you imagine a blue Ferrari?
You are my best friend.
I am looking forward to seeing you next Sunday.
I was fortunate to find a good job.
I assure you everything will be ready on time.
I know that Tom is correct.
There's a storm incoming.
I don't speak French every day.
He met the girl on his way home yesterday.
He shows warm affection for his children.
Can you put that into French?
Where are all the flying cars?
Tom wants you to go to Boston with Mary.
He sashayed around the room.
Tom asked his girlfriend's father for permission to marry his daughter.
What do you do when you have a financial disagreement in your family?
Scotland is famous for its woollen textiles.
Would you please tell me your full name and address?
Stop giving me orders.
I don't want to get the police involved.
My office is located downtown.
I usually get up at 7:00.
None of us want that.
Tom had to give up his dream.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
Tom wasn't sure Mary didn't know how to drive a car.
I'll stay in Athens for nine days.
How dare you insult Tom!
She was beautiful when she was young.
Maybe we can help them.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary has to do that.
I was just there last Monday.
Can you please be quiet?
Tom has been a perfect gentleman.
Tom said that he'd call you.
I'm not prepared.
She laced her shoes.
This stinks.
May I have permission to go inside?
I came here with Tom.
They live outside the city.
It wouldn't surprise me if Tom doesn't come.
It all makes sense now.
Can I wait for them here?
Tom is drinking some coffee.
Tom took the time to help us.
That would be suicidal.
Tom let himself in with his own key.
I'm happy for them.
Why wouldn't we do that?
He is hungry.
Several American presidents were murdered.
Do you want to take one?
Why would anyone want to attack Tatoeba?
You should probably buy a swimsuit.
Tom is now thinking about it.
The difference was unbelievable.
What's he doing?
We can't make Tom do something he doesn't want to do.
He has dull senses.
That woman's son is sick.
Tom invited Mary and her friends to dinner.
Tom spent time in Boston.
Tom talked to me today.
Tom always seems happy.
He was made captain of the team.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
Tom was surprised that Mary already knew what to do.
He seems to know the secret.
Fadil didn't have the permission to do that.
She tends to be late for school.
I want to do more.
His story is true.
Tom despises people who smoke.
I love Berber music.
When and where did you receive the gift?
It's surprising to know that your school starts at 8:30 and ends at 3:30.
I've agreed to meet Tom after school.
Fear is a great motivator.
I'll adapt quickly.
What possible difference could that make?
This watch is a real bargain.
Give water to the thirsty and food to the hungry.
It rained hard during the morning.
Don't talk rubbish.
We're buddies.
Tom hid the money in his underwear drawer.
They drank smoothies.
These snails are cannibals.
But for water, no man could live.
Tom doesn't like them.
You know what Tom did, don't you?
She gave me advice as well as information.
Here we are!
That sounds interesting. What did you tell her?
I keep having this dream about drowning.
I'd better see him.
Tom is afraid to go out after dark, isn't he?
The bus was about to start.
We prefer tea or coffee.
You should thank Tom for helping.
Tom was friendly.
I know what I want to buy.
Tom had his leg bandaged by Mary.
She will grow up to be a very good pianist.
I have some old clothes I'm going to throw out.
Tom is an amazing actor.
I've worked three hours already.
Tom called Mary every ten minutes.
Isn't that what you said?
Pull me up.
I think it's silly that Tom is learning French.
Tom was bright.
That is not art. That is a vagina dentata.
I didn't tell anyone about it.
There is a dog in this room.
I hope that Tom will never do that again.
Tom is my father.
Tom and Mary are almost ready.
Don't leave your hands outside the window.
This is what we found.
Have you ever sat in a helicopter?
Tom went fishing the day before yesterday.
You have a very pleasant voice.
I outsmarted you.
It was a very sweet kiss.
Tom said that he'd help me do that.
I can't sing very well.
Someone is standing behind the wall.
Neither Tom nor Mary has been doing that.
I've told you what I think.
I want everything.
I'd like to know why Tom isn't here.
I put some cream in my coffee.
Tom was given full custody of the children.
His face was full of hate.
What's Tom baking?
He is an FBI agent.
The teacher said that we are the future of the fatherland.
Do you have a snow shovel?
Hurry up, Tom.
I think she works in this office.
Would you help me?
I wish I had the time to stay and talk with you.
My impression of this government is that they need a more forceful economic policy, otherwise they'll encounter large problems in the future.
A week consists of a hundred and sixty-eight hours.
It appears that the victim tried to write the murderer's name with his own blood.
I only wear glasses for reading.
John is my nephew.
They killed themselves.
Even though Tom is one of my neighbors, I don't know him very well.
The event is on Monday.
Hey, you two! What are you doing?
Sami wasn't supposed to kill anybody.
Unfortunately, she lives abroad.
That is too scary.
I think we shouldn't swim today.
My legs are fine.
Are you busy right now?
I could spend hours in here.
Neither Tom nor Mary has a boat.
Tom was unable to conceal his anger.
I found out where she was.
They seemed to be discussing a matter of great importance.
Tell me what you did on your holidays.
I can't keep lying to them.
You have a beautiful dog.
I was going to tell Tom about that.
I am digging a well.
I can't understand what he is thinking about.
Yesterday, the weather was very nice.
Did you leave the door open last night?
Tom took Maria in his arms and gave her a kiss on the cheek.
Tom invited me to Mary's party even though she didn't want me there.
He and his father are like two peas in a pod.
Something seems to be worrying you.
His wife is a friend of mine.
The princess lives at the top of the tower.
We're just chilling.
Tom came home from work early today.
I think Tom may be right this time.
This is for him.
This politician resigned after being linked to a corruption scandal.
In this way, the students of the University have the opportunity to expand their cultural horizons.
This mustard really bites the tongue.
You should do that now.
Find a good job.
Students are required to perform one hour of community service per week.
Tom isn't ready for that.
How can you concentrate?
I don't want you to do that anymore.
I really want to see you today.
That's what Tom would've done.
Which train takes us to Kamakura?
I'm going to subscribe to these chamber-music concerts.
Let's have a birthday party for Tom.
Tom visited Mary on Sunday morning.
We stared at them.
We were having problems with Tom.
Just say yes.
You'll have to ask someone else.
I'll take the responsibility.
It's always sunny in Italy.
Giraffes are the world's tallest animals.
Let's get out of the storm.
I was with him for an hour.
You don't want anything to do with us.
Tom denied the request.
Alice went to bed at ten.
Many Hindus consider Sanskrit to be the language of the gods.
Tom will probably arrive before 2:30.
What do you want the list for?
I assume you already tried asking Tom for help.
